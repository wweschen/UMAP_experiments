newly available information."," Origins [ edit ] \n Hezbollah originated within the Shia block of Lebanese society."," According to a United States CIA World Factbook estimate, Shias comprise 28.","4 percent of Lebanon's population, [1] predominating in three areas of Lebanon: the South, Beirut and its environs, and the northern Beqaa valley and Hermel region."," Lebanon gained its independence on November 22, 1943, with the French army withdrawing its soldiers from Lebanon in 1946."," The Lebanese National Pact became the framework for governance, leading to the allocation of political privileges, such as membership in parliament as well as senior bureaucratic and political appointments, to each of the 17 recognized sectarian communities based roughly on the proportionate size of each community."," The two most important positions of the presidency and premiership were given to the Maronites and Sunnis respectively, with the Shia receiving the speakership of the parliament in recognition of their status as the third largest demographic group in the country."," Despite the appointment they remained politically, socially and financially marginalized."," Shi'a political movement before Hezbollah [ edit ] \n The Shi'a society began exploding during the 1960s and 70s."," In 1960 Imam Musa Sadr came to Lebanon to become the leading Shi'ite figure in the city of Tyre ."," He quickly became one of the most prominent advocates for the Shia population of Lebanon, a group that was both economically and politically disadvantaged."," In 1969 he was appointed as the first head of the Supreme Islamic Shi'ite Council , an entity meant to give the Shias more say in government."," In 1974 he founded the \"Movement of the Deprived\" to press for better economic and social conditions for the Shi'ites."," He established a number of schools and medical clinics throughout southern Lebanon, many of which are still in operation today."," During Lebanese Civil War he at first aligned himself with the Lebanese National Movement , and the Movement of the Disinherited developed an armed wing known as Afwaj al-Mouqawma Al-Lubnaniyya , better known as Amal ."," [5] Although Amal had its genesis in the Movement of the Dispossessed (Harakat al-Mahrumin), founded by the charismatic scholar Musa as-Sadr, when Sadr was abducted it turned briefly to the secular leadership of Husayn Husayni in 1979, and since 1980, Nabih Berri ."," [6] Under Berri's leadership, Amal alienated many religious Shias by supporting the Syrian-backed presidency of Elias Sarkis and compromising Sadr's struggle for social and political reforms."," The secularization of Amal provided the Najaf deportees with an ideal setting to spread their militant brand of Shia activism."," Whereas Musa Sadr viewed the Lebanese state as a legitimate entity in need of reform and had developed close ties with reform-minded Christian politicians, some Lebanese seminarians in Najaf refused to accept the state of Lebanon, its current borders, or its consociational power-sharing formula as unassailable facts."," [7] This group organized under supervision of Iraqi Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr (the cousin of Musa), one of the leading clerics in the Shia seminary (hawza) of Najaf in Iraq."," These clerics theorized about an Islamic state woven of a clandestine network that became known as Hizb al-Da'wa (the \"Party of the Calling\")."," [8] This network was established in Lebanon by clerics who returned from Najaf like Sayyed Abbas al-Musawi ."," Hezbollah's emergence [ edit ] \n According to Ahmad Nizar Hamzeh in \" In the Path of Hizbullah \" four crisis conditions catalyzed the emergence of Hezbollah: [9] ."," When Lebanon became independent on November 22, 1943, \"the Shiites felt that they were the despised stepchildren of a state governed by a Maronite-Sunni alliance.","\"(Hamzeh, 2004: 12 [10] ) The Shias were ripe for every Shi'a protective organization like Hezbollah."," Shias were politically underrepresented, based on the National Pact of 1943, which vested legislative and executive as well as military positions in rough proportion to the demographic size of the country's eighteen recognized sectarian groupings."," In 1946, the Christian Maronites and the Sunni Muslims occupied 40 and 27 percent, respectively, of the highest civilian posts."," By the 1980s, Shias had become Lebanon's largest single confessional community with almost 1,400,000 people, surpassing the Maronite and Sunni populations, which were each estimated at nearly 800,000 a piece (Hamzeh, 2004: 13 [11] ) The Shiites believed that their representation was not commensurate with their numerical size."," Economically the broader Shia community in Lebanon was very poor."," Almost 85 percent lived in the rural region of South Lebanon and in one area of the Beqaa Valley , and subsisted on what they earned, mostly from selling tobacco to the state monopoly or growing vegetables."," They were also exposed to the military fighting between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)."," To escape these conditions, many Shias migrated to the slums of eastern Beirut and shantytowns in the suburbs south of Beirut."," Hamzeh writes that \"[t]hese two areas, known as the \"belt of misery,\" became the breeding ground of Shia militancy in the 1980s."," (Hamzeh, 2004: 14 [12] ) Even in the 1960s and 70s, the charismatic leader Imam Musa al-Sadr began to activate the politically quiescent Shias of Lebanon."," \"When identity crisis and structural imbalance are reinforced by military defeat, a society's militancy potential increases markedly."," Military defeat followed by foreign occupation opens the way for militant movements fostering political organization or employing guerrilla warfare and enjoying widespread grassroots support."," (Hamzeh, 2004: 15 [13] ) This is what happened when Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 ( Operation Litani ) and 1982 ( Lebanon War ), actions which, according to Hamzeh were undertaken in order to remove the PLO from Lebanon and disassociate Lebanon from Syria 's influence."," Israel hoped that \"a Lebanon freed from Syria and the PLO, with a Christian-dominated regime, would bring peace and closer connections between the two countries.","\" (Hamzeh, 2004: 16 [14] ) But these operations oppressed Shi'a which lived in south Lebanon."," The Israelis killed more than one thousand civilian Shias, leading to a mass exodus of yet more Shia refugees to the Beirut slums."," [ citation needed ] Israel's 1982 invasion and occupation of Lebanon bolstered the fortunes of Hizbullah by \"providing a politic-military environment that legitimated the group and gave a rationale for its guerrilla warfare."," Similarly, the presence of the Western foreign troops in Lebanon, particularly of the U."," Marines , also boosted the fortunes of Hezbollah, which considered fighting such forces to be as legitimate as fighting the Israeli occupation."," According to Hamzeh \" Iran's revolution had its greatest impact in Lebanon,\" even though the two countries are not adjacent, because Lebanon's long-suffering Shias were most receptive to Iran's Islamic revolutionary message(Hamzeh, 2004: 18 [15] )."," Shia clerics from Lebanon, Iraq and Iran , in particular Khomeini , had known each other well in the Shia city of Najaf in Iraq where they participated in their \"circles of learning.","\" Soon after Khomeini's victorious return to Iran on February 1, 1979, he became the unchallenged

maintain that Hezbollah remained an amalgamation of various violent Shi'a extremists until as late as 1985."," [22] Another version states that it was formed by supporters of Sheikh Ragheb Harb , a leader of the southern Shia resistance killed by Israel in 1984."," [23] Regardless of when the name came into official use, a number of Shi'a groups were slowly assimilated into the organization, such as Islamic Jihad , Organization of the Oppressed on Earth and the Revolutionary Justice Organization ."," [ citation needed ] These designations are considered to be synonymous with Hezbollah by the US, [24] Israel [25] and Canada ."," [26] The organization developed in a milieu, which included the Iranian revolution in 1979, oppression of Shias by Sunnis and Christians in Lebanon, and Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982."," In 1982, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was based in Southern Lebanon and was firing Katyusha rockets into northern Israel from Lebanon."," Israel invaded Lebanon to evict the PLO, and Hezbollah became an armed organization to expel the Israelis."," Hezbollah's strength was enhanced by the dispatching of one thousand [28] to fifteen hundred [29]

Civil War ."," After emerging during the civil war of the early 1980s as an Iranian-sponsored second resistance movement (besides Amal ) for Lebanon's Shia community, Hezbollah focused on expelling Israeli and Western forces from Lebanon."," Although Hezbollah battled the Amal militia for control of Shia areas and vigorously attacked Israel's Lebanese proxies(SLA) , unlike other wartime militias, it never engaged in sectarian bloodletting (or fought a major engagement with the army) during the war."," Suicide attacks [ edit ] \n Hezbollah is reputed to have been among the first Islamic resistance groups to use tactical suicide bombing in the Middle East, [38] and early bombings attributed to the group (e."," the Tyre truck bombings and the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing ) inspired other militant extremist groups to adopt the tactic for their own purposes.","\nThe predominantly Shia residents of south Lebanon had born the brunt of the Israeli invasion, which sent floods of refugees into the Beqaa and Beirut (already teaming with a 300,000 strong southern \"poverty belt\" of newly urbanized Shias), eager for recruitment."," Many politicized Shias also felt victimized by the entry of an American and European multi-national force (MNF) into Beirut in 1982, not only because it was perceived as pro-Israeli, but also because its mission was to support a government beholden to the right-wing Christian Phalange Party (led by then-President Amine Gemayel ) and Sunni Beiruti notables (e."," Prime Minister Shafik Wazzan ) and quick to assert its newfound strength by unceremoniously ejecting Shiite squatters from posh neighborhoods of West Beirut near the airport."," Although Hezbollah avoided direct confrontation with the state, it lashed out with fury at the MNF, most notably with the October 1983 twin suicide bombings that killed more than 300 American and French servicemen ( 1983 Beirut barracks bombing ), forcing its withdrawal in 1984."," The following year, in the face of mounting Hezbollah attacks, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) began redeploying to a thin \"security zone\" in the south."," Jeffrey Goldberg writes in The New Yorker that during this period Hezbollah."," quickly became the most successful terrorist organization in modern history, [serving] as a role model for terror groups around the world, .","and virtually invent[ing] the multipronged terror attack when, early on the morning of October 23, 1983, it synchronized the suicide bombings , in Beirut , of the United States Marine barracks and an apartment building housing a contingent of French peacekeepers ."," (note: Hezbollah did not claim responsibility for these attacks."," Despite targeting military forces - actually peacekeepers - the bombing is considered an act of terrorism because it was carried out by illegal combatants acting outside of the Combatants Privilege provided by the Third Geneva Convention )."," According to Robert Pape 's Dying to Win , [39] \nHezbollah conducted three distinct suicide bombing campaigns against forces it deemed to be occupying Lebanon:."," 1983\u20131984: 5 acts against the US and France, [39] including these specific acts:."," [39] \n 1985\u20131986: 20 acts against Israel and the South Lebanon Army ."," [39] \n In addition to these campaigns, Pape documents six other isolated suicide attacks taken by Hezbollah between 1985 and 1999."," Upon Israel's withdrawal from South Lebanon in 2000, according to Pape, the necessary conditions for Hezbollah's continuing use of suicide attacks evaporated."," Hezbollah has not directly participated in suicide bombings since 1999, its leaders evidently having renounced the tactic."," Attacks against Western targets [ edit ] \n Hezbollah is believed by the United States' intelligence agencies to have."," In early 1998, Lebanon's highest court announced that it intended to arrest the Secretary-General (until 1991) of Hezbollah, Sheikh

this agreement, Syria , in control of Lebanon at that time (with the support of Iran ), allowed Hezbollah to maintain their arsenal, control the Shia areas in Southern Lebanon along the border with Israel."," The continued existence of Hezbollah's military wing after 1990 is considered by the UN to violate the Taif Agreement ."," Hezbollah, however, justifies maintaining its militia on the basis

Hezbollah is a national resistance movement."," And because of that, we have big esteem for the Hezbollah movement."," After Israeli forces left Southern Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah provided military

arms.","\" [72] Hezbollah says Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon proves that the Jewish state only understands the language of resistance."," It defends its right to keep its weapons as a deterrent against Israeli attack, to liberate the disputed Shebaa Farms border area, which is occupied by Israel."," Since Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000, and until the conflict arising in

foreign occupiers in Lebanon, Hezbollah has been responsible for murderous terror attacks against Israeli, American, and Jewish targets around the globe."," Despite its rhetoric of freeing Lebanon from foreign occupation, Hezbollah has made no secret that it is heavily supported by foreign powers, namely the Islamist Iranian regime."," Iran has transferred mass quantities of weapons, fighters, and other supplies to Hezbollah through its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, using Syria as a transfer point."," It has been responsible for transferring thousands of rockets, which Hezbollah has used against Israeli civilians, notably in the 2006 Second Lebanon War which was sparked by a Hezbollah cross-border raid that resulted in the deaths of eight soldiers and capture of two others."," In addition to its violently anti-Israel position, Hezbollah\u2019s loyalty to Iran and Syria has translated into Hezbollah involvement on behalf of the embattled Syrian regime in that country\u2019s civil war."," Like Iran, Hezbollah considers the United States and Israel to be its chief enemies, which has led to a global terrorist campaign against the two nations."," Until September 11, 2001, Hezbollah was responsible for killing more Americans than any other terrorist organization."," Among other deadly attacks, Hezbollah has been linked to the 1983 attack on U."," Marine barracks in Lebanon; the 1992 suicide bombing at the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina; the 1994 suicide bombing of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association in Buenos Aires; and the 2012 bombing of an Israeli tourist bus in Bulgaria."," Hezbollah is also suspected of involvement in the February 2005 Beirut suicide bombing that killed 23 people, including former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri."," Further complicating Hezbollah\u2019s status, the terror group has woven itself into Lebanon\u2019s social fabric, setting up charities and providing services in the southern part of the country where government authority is weaker."," These social services have boosted Hezbollah\u2019s popularity enough to allow it to become part of the Lebanese political structure."," Since 1992, Hezbollah has had a presence and outsized influence in the elected government."," Hariri\u2019s 2005 death sparked an internal revolution\u2014dubbed the Cedar Revolution\u2014in Lebanon that led to

8 faction, which also include the Shiite Amal party and the Christian-aligned Free Patriotic Movement (FPM)."," Though it is itself a smaller party in the parliament, Hezbollah\u2019s political party has stalled the creation of governing coalitions and caused their downfall through the withdrawal of Hezbollah support."," In October 2016, the Lebanese government elected Hezbollah political ally

Revolution."," The revolution called for a religious Muslim government that would represent the oppressed and downtrodden."," According to Hezbollah, the United States was to blame for many of the country\u2019s problems."," Israel was seen as an extension of the United States and a foreign power in Lebanon."," The organization itself started in 1982 as part of the Iranian government\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps."," Led by religious clerics, the organization wanted to adopt an Iranian doctrine as a solution to Lebanese political malaise."," This doctrine included the use of terror as a means of attainting political objectives."," Toward the end of 1982, Iran sent fighters to assist in the establishment of a revolutionary Islamic movement in Lebanon."," Iran\u2019s hope was that the new members would participate in the Jihad , or Holy War, against Israel."," These forces, which were located in the area of Ba\u2019albek in the northern Beqa\u2019a valley, brought Iranian-Islamic influence to the area and constituted the core of the Hezbollah organization in Lebanon."," As the organizational infrastructure developed, Hezbollah, with Iranian and Syrian assistance, began to establish an extensive military network in the Ba\u2019albek area."," Its militias have since spread into the Shi\u2019ite neighborhoods in southern and western Beirut as well as into southern Lebanon."," Thousands of Hezbollah activists and members are located in the Beqa\u2019a valley, Beirut and southern Lebanon."," These areas also offer a base for the recruitment of additional activists and fighters among the local Shi\u2019ite populations."," After Israel\u2019s war in Lebanon , the organization gained strength as it fought against the presence of French and American peacekeepers who remained in Lebanon after Israeli forces withdrew from Beirut."," In 1985, the IDF withdrew from Lebanon, with the exception of a security zone created to protect Israel\u2019s northern border."," For the next five years Israeli troops worked with the South Lebanese Army to defend the border."," Meanwhile, Hezbollah stockpiled weapons and and recruited many new members, all with the goal of driving the Israelis out of Lebanon."," To gain support from the local population in South Lebanon, Hezbollah donated money, equipment, and medical supplies."," State Department added Hezbollah to its list of terrorist organizations ."," Following Israel\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah continued to mount terrorist operations against Israel."," It accused Israel of continuing to hold Shaba\u2019a Farm lands (which Israel and the UN agree are not part of Lebanon) and refusing to release Lebanese prisoners in Israeli jails."," In response, Hezbollah, with the help of a UN peacekeeping force, kidnapped three IDF soldiers."," A prisoner swap was not agreed upon until 2004, four years after the kidnapping."," Building its Arsenal (2000-2005) \n The \u201c Al-Aqsa intifada \u201d in Israel created additional opportunities for Hezbollah to perform acts of violence against the Jewish state."," The organization funded the Palestinian Authority (PA) and collaborated with other terrorist organizations, including Hamas , to systematize attacks on Israel."," It stepped up its recruitment in order to more efficiently infiltrate Israel\u2019s international borders."," It also continued to smuggle arms and advanced weapons into Lebanon from Syria and Iran and the PA."," In 2002, the IDF intercepted a Palestinian Authority-owned ship, the Karine - A , carrying 50 tons of weapons, including anti-tank missiles, Katyusha rockets, and long range mortar bombs."," A senior Hezbollah member was responsible for loading the weapons onto the ship."," During this time, Iran and Syria both financially supported Hezbollah, facilitating its military growth to help enable it to fight Israel with more precision and lethality."," Second Lebanon War & Aftermath \n On July 12, 2006, the military and financial support that Hezbollah had been receiving from Iran and Syria was put to the test when its guerrilla\u2019s perfidiously attacked an IDF patrol on the Israel-Lebanon border and abducted two soldiers, Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev ."," Simultaneously, Hezbollah units inside Lebanon began firing katyusha rockets to pound northern Israel and create panic and fear."," After more than a weeklong campaign of artillery and air fire to suppress Hezbollah targets, the IDF invaded southern Lebanon at the end of July with the mission to destroy Hezbollah\u2019s military capability and kill as many of its terrorists and fighters as possible."," Though the war is widely considered to have ended in a stale-mate, with neither side producing a decisive victory, Israel maintains that it killed nearly 600 Hezbollah guerrillas and destroyed tons of their illegal weaponry."," Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah mentioned in various interviews that he did not expect such a high level response and invasion by the IDF following the initial attack but that he believes his forces acted heroically and not only withstood the Israeli assault but inflicted their own damage, killing more than 120 Israeli soldiers."," In the aftermath of the month-long war in 2006, the United Nations was tasked with maintaining a UNIFIL force both on Israel\u2019s border with Lebanon to prevent future skirmishes, but also on Lebanon\u2019s border with Syria to prevent further arms smuggling into the Hezbollah stronghold areas."," Unfortunately, UNIFIL\u2019s mission has been compromised either by a lack of desire on the part of its soldiers to interfere or a lack of ability to stop the smuggling."," Israeli intelligence now believes that Hezbollah has completely rearmed itself from the 2006 war and has even enhanced its weapons stock further, despite UNIFIL\u2019s presence."," It is believed that Hezbollah\u2019s weapons stores hold at least 10,000 katyusha and other short to medium-range rockets."," In January 2012, the IDF further updated its operational assessment of Hezbollah to say that it believed the terrorist organization now had long-range surface-to-air missile systems imported from Syria that can match Israel\u2019s aerial dominance."," The upheaval in Syria during the winter of 2011/2012 enabled Hezbollah to obtain the weapons systems in addition to other various Russian-made air-defense units."," While Hezbollah is known to have a large quantity of shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles, the IDF now assumes that the Lebanese Islamist group has received the SA-8, a truck-mounted Russian tactical surface- to-air missile system reported to have a range of 30 kilometers."," In addition to the possible transfer of air-defense systems, Hezbollah is also believed to have received several dozen more M600 long-range missiles, as well as additional 302 mm."," Khaibar-1 rockets, which have a range of about 100 kilometers."," In November 2013, security officials learned that Hezbollah had close to 200 Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), including those that can track movement from high altitude and \u201ckamikazes\u201d that can avoid capture by radar and fire or drop munitions from low altitudes."," On October 7, 2014 an explosive device was detonated on the Israel controlled side of the Israeli-Lebanon border."," Hezbollah immediately took responsibility for the attack less than 4 hours after it happened, which is surprising considering their record of denying any attacks against Israel that they have been accused of."," This marks the first time that Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for an attack against Israel since the Second Lebanon War in 2006."," The explosive device was detonated in the area of Sheeba Farms, an area that Lebanon believes is unrightfully occupied by Israel, and that Syria also claims the rights to."," The explosion seriously injured 2 Israeli soldiers and was supposedly a retaliatory attack in response to an incident on Sunday in which IDF soldiers witnessed individuals attempting to illegally cross from Lebanon into Israel."," The IDF soldiers opened fire at these individuals and caused them to retreat back to Lebanese territory."," According to Lebanese sources this is not how the confrontation proceeded, and they claim that Israeli soldiers fired on their military positions, injuring one soldier."," According to IDF spokesman Lt Colonel Peter Lerner, this attack was a \u201cblatant breach of Israel\u2019s sovereignty.","\u201d In response to this attack, the Israeli military fired artillery at two Hezbollah positions in Southern Lebanon, no injuries were reported."," In a rare televised appearance on November 4 2014, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned of a third Lebanon war and stated that Israel should close \u201call of your airports and your ports\u201d in the event of a third Lebanon war."," Nasrallah threatened Israel and claimed that \u201cthere is no place on the land of occupied Palestine that the resistance\u2019s rockets cannot reach."," Israeli warplanes struck multiple positions in Damascus on Sunday December 7 2014 in an attempt to thwart weapons transfers to Hezbollah in Lebanon ."," These strikes hit a storage facility that was housing anti-aircraft missiles and drone fighters that were going to be sold to Hezbollah ."," Two Israeli soldiers were killed and seven more injured when their military convoy was attacked while driving along the Israel side of the Lebanese border in the area of Shebaa Farms on January 28, 2015."," The soldiers names were released the following day: Captain Yohai Kalangel and Sergeant Dor Nini."," Israeli forces stationed at Mount Hermon were also fired upon."," It is thought that the attack was carried out as a response to an Israeli air strike inside of Syria the week before that killed five Hezbollah fighters and an Iranian general."," Hezbollah immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, and issued a statement claiming that the Quneitra Martyrs Brigade had fired the rockets at the Israelis."," Shortly after the initial attack the Hezbollah militants fired more mortar shells at Israeli military positions near the border, but no injuries were reported."," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took to social media and explained that Israeli forces had responded to the attacks with \u201ccombined aerial and ground strikes\u201d on Hezbollah positions."," This exchange represented the most serious development in Lebanon-Israel relations in years, and Israeli Lt."," Colonel Peter Lerner referred to the situation as \u201ca severe escalation\u201d on Israel\u2019s Northern border."," Military battalions from Israel returned fire and there were missiles being lobbed back and forth across the border during the afternoon, but by the next morning tensions had eased and the situation had resolved itself."," This attack was condemned with harsh words in a statement from the State Department Spokesperson Jen Psaki."," Psaki reminded the world that \u201cHezbollah continues to incite violence and instability inside Lebanon by attacking Israel and by its presence and fighting inside Syria,\u201d and extended her condolences to the victim\u2019s families."," The following day Israeli officials received a correspondence from a United Nations peacekeeping force operating in Lebanon, claiming that Hezbollah was not interested in any further escalation of conflict."," Israel defense Minister Moshe Ya\u2019alon stated in response that \u201cUntil the area completely calms down, the Israel Defense Forces will remain prepared and ready."," Following the January 2015 attack, Israeli security forces set to work drilling deep around the perimeter fences meant to keep the border communities safe, looking for Hezbollah infiltration tunnels."," Although residents had claimed to have heard noises coming from underneath their homes, and security officials are convinced that Hezbollah is planning for their next attack, no tunnels were found."," Benny Gantz made it clear that Israeli border towns need to be better protected from these threats, and asked for more funding for the IDF to protect these vulnerable areas in the days after the attack."," Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah acknowledged for the first time on February 16, 2015, that Hezbollah had sent fighters into Iraq to combat the Islamic State ."," During the taped speech Nasrallah encouraged Arab states in the region to fight the Islamic State aligned with Hezbollah, and to abandon their US allies."," It had been reported that Hezbollah had been sending fighters into Iraq to combat the Islamic State since mid-2014, but this speech represents the first time that Hezbollah leaders have acknowledged the existence of these fighters."," Intelligence Communities removed Hezbollah and Iran from its list of terrorism threats for the first time in recent history in February 2015."," Senate by the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, detailed how Iran had \u201cintentions to dampen sectarianism, build responsive partners, and deescalate tensions with Saudi Arabia\u201d during the past year."," Iran and Hezbollah were still listed in the Defense Intelligence Agency\u2019s terrorism threat assessment."," Four individuals from Syria approached the Syria-Israel border armed with ammunition and explosives under the cover of darkness on April 25, 2015."," These individuals were spotted by Israeli security services as they attempted to set up explosive devices on the border fence."," The Israeli Air Force was informed of this suspicious activity, and all four individuals were killed in an air-strike soon after they were spotted."," It was assumed after the attempted attack that these terrorists were members of Hezbollah."," The majority Saudi-owned satellite company Arabsat dropped Hezbollah\u2019s Al-Manar television station from its broadcasts in December 2015."," Arabsat was not the first provider to drop the Hezbollah channel, but it is one of the largest."," The Al-Manar station is banned in France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Brazil, Canada, and Australia, and is classified on the U."," Hezbollah\u2019s Al-Manar channel is still broadcast around the globe by Egypt\u2019s Nilesat, Russia\u2019s Express, and Indonesia\u2019s Indosat."," Hezbollah fighters set off a large explosive device as an Israeli armored convoy drove past near the Lebanon border on January 4, 2015."," The attack was in retaliation for the killing of Samir Kantar, a prominent Lebanese militant fighter who was killed in Syria during December 2015."," The IDF responded with targeted artillery fire against Hezbollah outposts."," The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) officially recognized Hezbollah as a terrorist organization on March 1, 2015."," The action was prompted by Hezbollah attempting to recruit fighters and smuggle weapons and drugs within GCC states, according to a spokesperson."," Prominent Hezbollah leader Mustafa Amine Badreddine was killed in an alleged air strike near Damascus airport in early May 2016."," Badreddine was a well-respected member of the organization, who was believed to have been behind all of Hezbollah\u2019s activities in Syria since 2011."," In a periodic report on the implementation of UN resolution 1701 released in March 2017, Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres argued that recent statements and rhetoric espoused by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah increase the risk of tension and could lead to renewed war between Hezbollah and Israel."," An Israeli air strike on April 26, 2017, destroyed a Hezbollah operated supply hub near the Damascus Airport in Syria."," Regular shipments of weapons were sent from Iran to Hezbollah militants through the supply depot."," A similar Israeli air strike struck and destroyed a weapons warehouse belonging to Hezbollah five months later, on September 24, 2017."," Speaking at the annual Herzliya security conference near Tel Aviv in June 2017, Israeli Air Force Major-General Amir Eshel stated that if war were to break out with Hezbollah once again, Israel would open with all our strength from the start."," Assuring the audience that Israel contains air power unimaginable in its scope, Eshel bragged that what the air force was able to do quantitatively in the\u2026 Lebanon war over the course of 34 days we can do today in 48-60 hours."," The Trump administration announced a new public campaign against Hezbollah in October 2017, including cash rewards for the groups most wanted members and stepped up counterterrorism and intelligence efforts."," On November 20, 2017, Nasrallah boasted in a speech that Hezbollah is proud and honored to say we sent Kornet missiles to the Gaza Strip."," Arab League officials accused Iran of destabilizing activities in the region and labelled Hezbollah a terrorist organization in November 2017, but stopped short at taking any action against either."," Nasrallah announced on December 11, 2017, that \u201cJerusalem, Palestine and the Palestinian people will return to being the priorities\u201d for the group, following the fall of ISIS in Syria and President Donald Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital."," Nasrallah called on all Arab nations to cease relations with Israel and engage in resistance on behalf of the Palestinian people."," Nasrallah made the announcement in Beirut, Lebanon, to a crowd of thousands gathered at a rally."," In early 2018, the IDF began construction of a ten-meter high concrete wall along the Lebanon-Israel border, to keep Hezbollah operatives from infiltrating Israeli territory."," A representative from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) announced that the organization was closely monitoring the construction to ensure the work stays on the Israeli side of the border to prevent unnecessary tension."," Policies & Politics \n Hezbollah has consistently tried to paint itself as a moderate national liberation organization aimed at \u201cintroducing the Islam that is confident in achieving justice, as well as introducing the Islam that protects all human rights.","\u201d It tries to portray an image as a group who would rather not commit acts of terror, but must for the benefit of the Arab world ."," After expressing written statements against terrorist attacks, the Secretary General of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah , communicated to a Lebanese audience at a memorial for a Hezbollah suicide bomber that \u201cwe must continue the path of resistance and the path of the First and Second Intifada."," In 1992, it participated in elections for the first time, winning 12 out of 128 seats in parliament."," In the general election of 2005, it won 23 seats nationwide."," An alliance between Amal and Hezbollah won all 23 seats in Southern Lebanon."," Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri unexpectedly resigned November 4, 2017, during a trip to Saudi Arabia , saying his life was in danger and accusing Iran of causing \u201cdevastation and chaos.","\u201d Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir subsequently described Hezbollah as a \u201cfirst-class terrorist organization\" that should lay down its arms and respect Lebanon's sovereignty."," He accused Hezbollah of destabilizing the region, and said \u201cconsultations and coordination between peace-loving countries and Lebanon-loving countries are underway to try to find a way that would restore sovereignty to Lebanon and reduce the negative action which Hezbollah is conducting in Lebanon.","\u201d Hariri later returned to Lebanon, withdrew his resignation and accused the Saudis of kidnapping him."," In May 2018, Lebanon held its first parliamentary election in nine years, which resulted in a strengthening of Hezbollah\u2019s grip on the government."," Hezbollah and its allies won 67 out of the 128 parliamentary seats."," The big loser was the Future Movement of Prime Minister Saad Hariri, which lost 13 seats and now has only 20."," The Lebanese Forces, which opposes Hezbollah, increased its representation, but still has only 15 seats."," Operations \n Hezbollah\u2019s main tactic is the use of suicide bombers ."," Hezbollah uses these human weapons to create mental and physical suffering for the Israelis and to force the Israelis to retreat out of \u201cIslamic land."," Shi\u2019a Islam international bases are used to buy and sell weapons for organized attacks."," Asia is a key target for Hezbollah, and Hezbollah has been pulling Malaysians and Indonesians into the organzation to expand operations and terrorist attacks around the world."," Hezbollah extended its operations across the globe throughout the 1980s, kidnapping individuals in a attempt to gain political leverage."," Hezbollah operates a satellite television station from Lebanon, Al-Manar TV (\u201cthe Lighthouse\u201d) as well as a radio station, al-Nour (\u201cthe light\u201d)."," Qubth Ut Alla (\u201cThe Fist of God\u201d) is the monthly magazine of Hezbollah\u2019s paramilitary wing."," They are widely viewed by West Bank and Gazan Palestinians as well as some Lebanese."," Leadership \n The spiritual father of the movement in Lebanon is Sheikh Muhammed Hussein Fadlallah who acts as chief Mujtahid (arbiter of Islamic law) of the Shi\u2019ite community in Lebanon."," The current Secretary General of Hezbollah is Hassan Nasrallah ."," At the start of the 1980s he was responsible for the Beqa\u2019a area on behalf of the AMAL movement."," He left the organization in 1982 and affiliated with Hezbollah, taking with him many of his followers."," Following the death of Abbas Musawi, Nasrallah was unanimously elected to be his successor."," Ideology & Support \n The organization views an Islamic republic, modeled after Iran, to be the ideal form of a state."," Lebanon remains a religiously and ideologically heterogeneous society."," According to their published political platform in 2003, Hezbollah claims to favor the introduction of an Islamic government in Lebanon by peaceful democratic means."," According to the United States Department of State and reports submitted to Defense Technical Information Center, the organization is seeking to create an fundamentalist Iranian-style Islamic republic and removal of all non-Islamic influences."," Hezbollah supports the destruction of the state of Israel and co-operates with other militant Islamic organizations such as Hamas in order to promote this goal."," In 1992, Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas signed an official agreement of cooperation."," As recently as 2002, it has been known that Iran was directly involved in numerous attempts to launch rockets into Israel through members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad who were trained by Hezbollah in Iranian camps."," A relationship has also developed between Hezbollah and Al-Qa\u2019ida, according to a former Al-Qa\u2019ida member who was captured and convicted of bombing U."," Ali Muhammad said that \u201cHezbollah provided explosives training for Al-Qa\u2019ida,\u201d and that he personally arranged a meeting between Hezbollah\u2019s chief and Osama bin Laden in Sudan ."," In 2002, leaders of Hezbollah, Al-Qa\u2019ida, and Hamas met formally in Lebanon to discuss future joint terrorist attacks against America, Britain, and Israel."," Syria backs Hezbollah morally and has also supplied it with money and arms."," In return, Hezbollah protects Syria\u2019s political and military interests in Lebanon."," Hezbollah also receives financial aid, training, weapons, and explosives from Iran."," Iran also contributes political, diplomatic, and organizational aid."," According to Iran\u2019s official budget, Iran gave $500 million in support of radical Islamic organizations around the world in the 1990s."," Of that money, Hezbollah was reported to receive at least $250 million."," It is also suspected that Hezbollah has received financial and military aid from Russia in the past."," Russia did not denounce Hezbollah as a terrorist organization until approximately twelve years after its establishment."," Hezbollah has a number of illicit fund-raising rings operating in the United States."," In 2003, the Drug Enforcement Administration discovered the existence of an organized drug smuggling operation that was funneling money to Hezbollah from Chicago and Detroit."," In Charlotte, North Carolina, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms investigated a multi-million dollar cigaretter smuggling ring that gave over $2 million to Hezbollah over a period of 8 years."," The money received from the Charlotte operation allowed Hezbollah to purchase advanced military technology

Hezbollah."," Activities Around the World \n Hezbollah is believed to have kidnapped and tortured to death U."," Higgins and the CIA Station Chief in Beirut, William Buckley, and to have kidnapped around 30 other Westerners between 1982 and 1992."," Hezbollah was suspected of involvement in numerous anti-US and anti-Israeli terrorist attacks."," The organization was responsible for the suicide truck bombings of the U."," Marine barracks in Beirut in October 1983, in which 241 American servicemen were killed (220 Marines, 18 Navy personnel and 3 Army soldiers) and the U."," The bombing at the Marine barracks in Beirut was the deadliest single-day death toll for the United States Marine Corps since the Battle of Iwo Jima (2,500 in one day) of World War II and the deadliest single-day death toll for the United States military since the 243 killed on 31st January 1968 \u2014 the first day of the Tet offensive in the Vietnam war."," The attack remains the deadliest single attack on Americans overseas since World War II ."," Three members of Hezbollah, Imad Mughniyeh , Hasan Izz-al-Din, and Ali Atwa, were on the FBI\u2019s list of 22 Most Wanted Terrorists for the hijacking in 1985 of TWA Flight 847 during which a U."," Mughniyeh was assassinated in 2008 in a joint CIA- Mossad operation."," Elements of the group were responsible for the kidnapping and detention of Americans and other westerners in Lebanon in the 1980s."," In 1989, Hezbollah terrorists planned to kidnap Israel\u2019s consul general in Sao Paolo or a diplomat in Brasilia to use as hostages for negotiations to free Hezbollah prisoners in Israel."," Security forces searched for the terrorists for a month before learning they had left the country."," Eight days after the boming of the Israeli embassy and the AMIA Jewish center in Buenos Aires , Argentina the Israeli Embassy in London was car bombed by two Palestinians linked to Hezbollah."," In January 2000, Hezbollah assassinated the commander of the South Lebanon Army Western Brigade, Colonel Aql Hashem, at his home in the security zone."," Hashem had been responsible for day to day operations of the South Lebanon army."," On June 16, 2004, two Palestinian girls \u2014 aged 14 and 15 \u2014 were arrested by the IDF for plotting a suicide bombing."," According to IDF statement, the two minors were guided by Hezbollah."," On June 23, 2004, another allegedly Hezbollah-funded suicide bombing attack was foiled by the Israeli security forces."," In February 2005, the Palestinian Authority accused Hezbollah of attempting to derail the truce signed with Israel."," Palestinian officials and former militants described how Hezbollah promised an increase in funding for any cell able to carry out a terrorist attack ."," Since the Second Lebanon War , Hezbollah operatives have been seen and, at times, even arrested in the Caribbean , Central America , South America and Asia ."," \u201cThere are parts of the Caribbean where we\u2019ve seen some, certainly some travel,\u201d said Henry Crumpton, the State Department\u2019s counter-terrorism coordinator said."," \u201cThere are parts of Central America where we\u2019ve seen some operatives, where we\u2019ve seen transactions \u2013 financial transactions \u2013 in the Caribbean."," In the southern part of the Caribbean, next to Venezuela , in Colombia , we\u2019ve seen some activity there."," In January 2012, one Hezbollah suspect was arrested and another managed to avoid capture, in Thailand\u2019s capital city, Bangkok, where security services believe they were working in a cell planning to attack areas commonly frequented by Israeli tourists."," The attacks were thought to have been planned in coordination with the anniversary of the assassination of Hezbollah operations chief Imad Mughniyeh on February 12."," Israeli counter-terror experts warned that Hezbollah\u2019s long arm was beginning to extend even further than many believed it could."," On October 7, 2014, an explosive device was detonated on the Israel controlled side of the Israeli-Lebanon border."," Hezbollah immediately took responsibility for the attack less than 4 hours after it happened, which is surprising considering their record of denying any attacks against Israel that they have been accused of."," This marked the first time that Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for an attack against Israel since the Second Lebanon War in 2006."," The explosive device was detonated in the area of Sheeba Farms, an area that Lebanon believes is unrightfully occupied by Israel, and that Syria also claims the rights to."," The explosion seriously injured two Israeli soldiers and was supposedly a retaliatory attack in response to an incident in which IDF soldiers witnessed individuals attempting to illegally cross from Lebanon into Israel."," The IDF soldiers opened fire at these individuals and caused them to retreat back to Lebanese territory."," According to Lebanese sources this is not how the confrontation proceeded, and they claim that Israeli soldiers fired on their military positions, injuring one soldier."," According to IDF spokesman Lt Colonel Peter Lerner, this attack was a \u201cblatant breach of Israel\u2019s sovereignty.","\u201d In response to this attack, the Israeli military fired artillery at two Hezbollah positions in Southern Lebanon, no injuries were reported."," Hezbollah in Latin America \n In 1992 and 1994, Hezbollah bombed the Israeli embassy and the AMIA Jewish center in Buenos Aires , Argentina ."," Secretary of State Rex Tillerson held a press conference with Argentinian Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie on February 4, 2018, where the two announced that their respective countries would begin doing more to cut off Hezbollah\u2019s funding networks in South America."," The Argentinian government froze the assets of a suspected Hezbollah fundraising network in July 2018, following an investigation into the Hezbollah-linked criminal organization the Barakat Group."," According to the Financial Information Unit of Argentina , Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese citizens in Argentina were laundering money through casinos in Iguazu to finance the groups terrorist activities."," A statement released by the Financial Information Unit claimed that the Barakat Group were involved in smuggling, falsifying of money and documents, extortion, drug trafficking, arms trafficking, money laundering and terrorist financing."," The United States Treasury targeted the Barakat Group in 2006, and named their leader, Assad Ahmad Barakat, as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in 2004."," A few weeks earlier, two other Lebanese nationals suspected of ties to Hezbollah and involvement in the network were arrested by Paraguayan authorities."," Hezbollah has a presence in Colombia under cover of a legitimate organization called the \u201cExternal Security Organization\u201d (ESO), which is essentially Unit 910, Hezbollah\u2019s foreign operations arm responsible for the 2012 terrorist attack in Burgas, Bulgaria and the attacks in Argentina during the 1990\u2019s."," Hezbollah\u2019s presence and activities were confirmed by the Colombian police in a three-year investigation carried out jointly with the U."," The investigation found that Iran directs the ESO through Lebanon and Hezbollah recruits Colombians from the 40,000 Muslims living in the country and sends them to Lebanon for indoctrination and training."," A senior member of the group responsible for Hezbollah operations in Panama was expelled from Colombia in 2017 after being indicted for drug smuggling and money laundering."," Imad Mughniyeh was the ESO\u2019s founder and leader until his assassination in 2008; its current head is Talal Hamiyeh."," Two alleged Hezbollah operatives were arrested in the United States on June 8, 2017."," Ali Kourani, 32, and Samer el Debek, 37, both naturalized U."," citizens, were charged with performing surveillance on prospective targets for attacks to be carried out by Hezbollah\u2019s external operations wing, Islamic Jihad."," Kourani, who was living in the Bronx, New York at the time of his arrest, had been gathering intelligence regarding operations and security at New York airports, and was working to identify individuals affiliated with the IDF in the U."," Born in Lebanon in 1984, Kourani relocated to the United States in 2003."," His family\u2019s home in Lebanon was allegedly destroyed during the 2006 Lebanon War , and two years later he was recruited into Hezbollah."," In 2016 and early 2017, Kourani was interviewed by the FBI multiple times, during which he mused that his family were the Bin Ladens of Lebanon, and bragged that one of his brothers was the face of Hezbollah in a particular Lebanese city."," Samer el Debek was living in Dearborn, Michigan when he was arrested, and had spent time observing security procedures at the Panama Canal and the Israeli Embassy in Panama, as well as identifying areas of weakness in the construction of the Panama canal."," El Debek admitted during meetings with the FBI that he was first recruited into Hezbollah in late 2007 or 2008, and travelled to Lebanon to train with Hezbollah fighters at least four times between 2009 and 2013."," An FBI special agent who interviewed el Debek stated that he possessed a high degree of technical sophistication in the area of bomb-making."," According to Colin Clarke, Hezbollah has had other operatives and activities in at least ten states."," The Goodwill Charitable Organization run out of Dearborn, Michigan for example, was used to transfer money from American supporters to Lebanon."," A money laundering scheme involved purchasing cars in the United States and reselling them in Africa."," Hezbollah has also engaged in cyberwarfare and hacked into systems in at least four states."," Clarke says the FBI conducted an intelligence investigation in the 1990s, Operation Smokescreen, which resulted in 26 people being charged with a variety of crimes."," Later, Operation Bathwater, uncovered what was then the largest credit card fraud scheme in U."," Since then, the government closely monitors Hezbollah activities in the United States and abroad."," Individuals affiliated with Hezbollah are barred from the United States and American citizens are prohibited from providing any material or financial support to the terrorists."," National Counterterrorism Center Nicholas Rasmussen told reporters during a briefing in October 2017 that Hezbollah is determined to give itself a potential homeland option to launch attacks within the United States."," The Trump administration is working to disrupt the group\u2019s fundraising, logistics and operations, and to demonstrate to any doubters that the group is a terrorist organization and not a legitimate political party."," As part of the new strategy to take on Iranian proxies in the Middle East, Rasmussen announced a $12 million reward for the capture of two top Hezbollah operatives: Talal Hamiyah ($7 million) and Fu\u2019ad Shukr ($5 million)."," Hamiyah is in charge of coordinating Hezbollah attacks outside of Lebanon, and Shukr played a central role in the 1983 attack on the U."," Drug Smuggling to Fund Terrorism \n Hezbollah finances its terrorism using a sophisticated drug-trafficking operation and continues to profit from its drug sales despite the world's objections."," Hezbollah primarily earns its profits through drug sales in Latin America , but its activities have been traced across multiple continents."," The group combines its drug profits with proceeds from legitimate used-car sales in West Africa."," Until it was uncovered by officials, this global money-laundering scheme effectively masked Hezbollah\u2019s earnings."," In 2001, international intelligence sources identified Lebanese residents operating for Hezbollah in South America\u2019s tri-border area ( Argentina , Paraguay and Brazil )."," That area is a major source of funding for Hezbollah\u2019s terror activities."," In October 2008, investigators took down a cocaine smuggling operation in Colombia , noting that \u201cprofits from the sales of drugs went to finance Hezbollah."," officials discovered a series of criminal schemes, which ranged from stolen laptops, passports, and gaming consoles to selling stolen and counterfeit currency, procuring weapons."," The origin of the plots was traced to a Hezbollah representative in Iran ."," In January 2010, German officials arrested two suspects in Frankfurt\u2019s airport after linking four Lebanese individuals to nearly 10 million euros in drug profits."," Officials accused the suspects of trading drugs and sending the proceeds to relatives directly connected to top Hezbollah officials."," government seized drug profits linked to Ayman Joumaa, a drug trafficker and money launderer, linked to Hezbollah ."," In April 2013, the United States Treasury Department took action against Hezbollah for working as a drug cartel and also blacklisted two Lebanese financial institutions, accusing them of transferring tens of millions of dollars to the terror group."," American officials later confirmed that one of the banks agreed to pay the United States $102 million to settle a lawsuit involving Hezbollah's money laundering scheme."," In June 2013, four Lebanese men were sanctioned for effectively acting as \u201cambassadors\u201d for Hezbollah in West Africa."," The United States Drug Enforcement Administration, with the assistance of France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, and other European nations, busted a drug smuggling network supplying money to Hezbollah operatives."," On February 1, 2016, the DEA announced the arrest of four individuals, accused of working with South American drug cartels to transport cocaine and other illicit drugs into the U."," and Europe and then using the drug money to buy weapons for Hezbollah."," On February 15, 2016, Panamanian authorities arrested a man travelling from Panama to Columbia with $500,000 cash in a suitcase on charges of managing drug-related

patron, Iran , Hezbollah forces joined the fight to keep Assad in power."," Syria has long been a defender of Hezbollah and one of its primary sources of weapons, most originating in Iran and smuggled to Lebanon ."," An estimated 8,000 members of the group, one-third of its force, are stationed in Lebanon."," Approximately 1,800 fighters, including some from its elite units, have been killed and 6,000 wounded."," It is also fighting without a supreme military commander after the assassination in 2008 of Imad Mughniyeh in a joint CIA- Mossad operation and the murder of his brother-in-law Mustafa Badreddine, who was rumored to have been killed in Damascus in 2016 by one of his own men on the orders of Hassan Nasrallah ."," On one hand, fighting has given Hezbollah a great deal of battlefield experience to prepare for a future war with Israel."," On the other hand, the Lebanese Shiite community has become increasingly restless over the group\u2019s involvement in what amounts to a foreign conflict."," Families are also suffering as loved ones return with disabling injuries or in body bags."," Hezbollah is also reportedly having financial difficulties, as its drug smuggling, money laundering and subsidies from Iran are insufficient to cover its expenses."," House unanimously passed the Hezbollah International Financial Prevention Act , aimed at stifling the finances of the Hezbollah terrorist organization."," The act ratchets up sanctions foreign financial institutions that are known to have dealings with Hezbollah."," Four individuals and one organization, Global Cleaners SARL, were sanctioned by the U."," Treasury on October 19, 2016, for providing assistance and support to Hezbollah."," The four men, Muhammad al-Mukhtar Kallas, Hasan Jamal-al-Din, Yosef Ayad, and Muhammad Ghaleb Hamdar, performed financial services for Hezbollah members and assisted in the planning and execution of acts of terror."," Two of the men were members of Hezbollah\u2019s External Security Organization, and one had been arrested in Peru in 2014, under suspicion of planning attacks in the country."," Global Cleaners SARL was found to be run by Hezbollah member and top financier Adham Tabaja."," Treasury Department announced new sanctions on February 2, 2018, against thirteen individuals and businesses allegedly associated with Hezbollah funding

that Hezbollah is building a military industry in Lebanon with the help of Iran."," One factory being constructed in northern Lebanon is designed to manufacture Fateh 110 medium-range missiles, which can reach most of Israel and carries a 500 kilogram warhead."," A second factory is being built on Lebanon's southern coast."," One reason for the new construction is that Israel has successfully interdicted a number of shipments of weapons from Syria."," The smuggling of arms and construction of weapons factories are violations of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 , which called for making southern Lebanon a weapons-free zone, except for the Lebanese army."," The UN has taken no action in response to these violations and the UNIFIL force continues to fail in its mission to prevent Hezbollah from moving personnel, weapons and and assets into the area near the border with Israel."," Israel also claimed Hezbollah was violating UN resolutions by setting up a network of observation posts along the border with Israel under the guise of a civilian organization called Green Without Borders."," In May 2018, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres submitted a semi-annual report on implementation of the 2004 Security Council resolution ordering all Lebanese militias to disarm."," He said Hezbollah\u2019s military activity violates the resolution and the Taif Accords that ended the country\u2019s 1975-90 civil war."," His report called on Lebanon\u2019s government and armed forces \u201cto take all measures necessary to prohibit Hezbollah and other armed groups from

has established the group\u2019s main political \u200eheadquarters in Beirut.","\u200e In addition, Hezbollah is training Hamas fighters at its bases in southern Lebanon."," Israel has repeatedly struck targets in Syria to prevent the land transfer of weapons to Hezbollah, but Iran has reportedly increased its delivery of weapons by air via Damascus."," According to former deputy Mossad chief Naftali Granot, Hezbollah has significantly upgraded its arsenal with the help of Iran."," \u201cIt got antiaircraft missiles, antitank missiles, and recently received small numbers of GPS precision-guided systems which will help it convert some heavy rockets into accurate missiles,\u201d he said in September 2018."," During his September 27, 2018, address at the UN General Assembly Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu showed photos of what he said were three Hezbollah \u201csecret sites\u201d: a football stadium, a location near Beirut International Airport and a residential neighborhood 500 meters from the airport\u2019s landing strip where the group is using Iranian technology to convert the group\u2019s rockets into precision-guided missiles capable of threatening targets deep inside Israel."," He accused Hezbollah of using civilian areas to shield them from Israeli airstrikes, but threatened to attack them if they were not shut down."," Netanyahu said on December 19, 2018, that Hezbollah had shut down plants to develop precision-guided missiles after Israel exposed them."," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in March 2019 that Hezbollah has built a new missile factory in Beirut with the help of Iran."," During a visit to Lebanon, Pompeo warned Prime Minister Saad Hariri that allowing the construction of facilities with the aim of manufacturing precision-guided missiles could provoke a response from Israel."," Another threat was exposed when Israel discovered a series of tunnels constructed by Hezbollah that extended across the Lebanese border into Israel ."," On December 3, 2018, the IDF launched Operation Northern Shield to destroy them."," Israeli officials have concluded Hezbollah is now largely in control of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF)."," This is particularly disturbing given that the LAF has received more than $1.","5 billion in assistance from the United States over the past twelve years and that LAF commander Joseph Aoun has said his forces intend to participate in any future war against Israel."," In the 2006 war , Israel distinguished between the two and restricted its operations to Hezbollah targets."," \u201cThe distinction we made between Hezbollah and Lebanon during the Second Lebanon War was a mistake,\u201d a senior officer in the Northern Command said."," We will hit Lebanon and any infrastructure that would contribute to the fighting."," As fears of a future conflict have grown, Israel decided to build an 80-mile security barrier along the border with Lebanon."," Lebanese officials have called the plan an \u201caggression,\u201d however, the entire project was planned, and is being implemented with close consultation between Israel and UNIFIL , which, in turn, informs the Lebanese army."," Members of the UK Parliament passed a non-binding resolution on January 28, 2018, classifying Hezbollah as a terrorist organization under the country\u2019s terrorism legislation."," Only the military wing of Hezbollah was designated a terrorist group in the UK previously, and this resolution additionally designated their political wing a terrorist organization."," In early 2019, the United Kingdom ended the fiction that a distinction can be made between Hezbollah\u2019s \u201cmilitary\u201d and \u201cpolitical\u201d wings and designated the entire organization a terrorist group."," British Home Secretary Sajid Javid said, \u201cThere have long been calls to ban the whole group with the distinction between the two factions derided as smoke and mirrors.","\u201d He added, \u201cHezbollah themselves have laughed off the suggestion there is a difference.",", Israel, the Netherlands and the Arab League in banning the terror organization."," A New Tactic \n In August 2019, Hezbollah appeared to adopt the arson techniques that Palestinians in Gaza have used repeatedly to attack Israel."," Hezbollah operatives set fires near the border and winds spread the flames toward an IDF base and the community of Margaliot."," Israeli news reported that officials believe Hezbollah were going to use this tactic to try to distract the IDF and clear

Program and our community of experts to gain a global audience for your work!."," Hezbollah , Arabic \u1e24izb All\u0101h (\u201cParty of God\u201d) , also spelled Hezbullah or Hizbullah , political party and militant group that first emerged during Lebanon \u2019s civil war as a militia after the Israeli invasion of that country in 1982."," Hezbollah The flag of Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group and political party."," Which of the following attacks has not been linked to Hezbollah? ."," Formation, political orientation, and conflict with Israel \n Shi\u02bfi Muslims, traditionally the weakest religious group in Lebanon, first found their voice in the moderate and largely secular Amal movement."," Following the Islamic revolution in Shi\u02bfi-majority Iran in 1979 and the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, a group of Lebanese Shi\u02bfi clerics formed Hezbollah with the goal of driving Israel from Lebanon and establishing an Islamic republic there."," Hezbollah was based in the predominately Shi\u02bfi areas of the Biq\u0101\u02bf Valley , southern Lebanon, and southern Beirut ."," It coordinated its efforts closely with Iran , from which it acquired substantial logistical support, and drew its manpower largely from disaffected younger, more radical members of Amal."," Throughout the 1980s Hezbollah engaged in increasingly sophisticated attacks against Israel and fought in Lebanon\u2019s civil war (1975\u201390), repeatedly coming to blows with Amal."," During that time, Hezbollah allegedly engaged in terrorist attacks including kidnappings and car bombings, directed predominantly against Westerners, but also established a comprehensive social services network for its supporters."," The civil war ended in 1990 after the imposition of a consociational arrangement in which the country\u2019s several religious sects shared power."," The agreement was to be enforced by Syrian forces, which had been drawn into the country\u2019s civil war in 1976."," As the political environment changed, so did Hezbollah\u2019s ideology and rhetoric ."," In 2009, while continuing to call for resistance to Israel as well as support for Iran, its updated manifesto dropped calls for the establishment of an Islamic republic in Lebanon and affirmed as its ideal government a democracy that represents national unity rather than sectarian interests."," Meanwhile, Hezbollah was one of the few militia groups not disarmed by the Syrians at the end of the civil war, and, as Lebanon divided into factions that either supported or opposed Syrian involvement in the country, Hezbollah firmly favoured Syria ."," In the fallout of the 2005 assassination of Rafiq al-Hariri , a former prime minister who opposed Syrian involvement, a popular backlash against Syria led to its decision to withdraw its forces from Lebanon."," On March 8, 2005, days after Syria announced its withdrawal, Hezbollah organized a massive rally in support of Syria; the date of this rally later served as the moniker for the pro-Syria bloc in Lebanese politics.","Get exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription."," Hezbollah also continued to fight a sustained guerrilla campaign against Israel in southern Lebanon until Israel\u2019s withdrawal in 2000."," Years later, on July 12, 2006, Hezbollah, in an attempt to pressure Israel into releasing three Lebanese jailed in Israeli prisons, launched a military operation against Israel, killing a number of Israeli soldiers and abducting two as prisoners of war."," This action led Israel to launch a major military offensive against Hezbollah."," The 34-day war between Hezbollah and Israel resulted in the deaths of more than 1,000 Lebanese and the displacement of some 1,000,000."," Fighting the Israel Defense Forces to a standstill\u2014a feat no other Arab militia had accomplished\u2014Hezbollah and its leader, Hassan Nasrallah , emerged as heroes throughout much of the Arab world."," Two years later, in July 2008, the bodies of the abducted soldiers were returned to Israel in exchange for five Lebanese prisoners and the bodies of about 200 others."," Asserting its permanence in the Lebanese polity \n In the months following the 2006 war, Hezbollah used its prestige to attempt to topple Lebanon\u2019s government after its demands for more cabinet seats were not met: its members, along with those of the Amal militia, resigned from the cabinet."," The opposition then declared that the remaining cabinet had lost its legitimacy and demanded the formation of a new government in which Hezbollah and its opposition allies would possess the power of veto."," Late the following year, efforts by the National Assembly to select a successor at the end of Lebanese Pres."," \u00c9mile Lahoud \u2019s nine-year term were stalemated by the continued power struggle between the Hezbollah-led opposition, the March 8 bloc, and the Western-backed March 14 bloc."," A boycott by the opposition\u2014which continued to seek the veto power it had been denied\u2014prevented the assembly from reaching a two-thirds quorum."," Lahoud\u2019s term expired in November 2007, and the presidency remained unoccupied as the factions struggled to reach a consensus on a candidate and the makeup of the new government."," In May 2008, clashes between Hezbollah forces and government supporters in Beirut were sparked by government decisions that included plans to dismantle Hezbollah\u2019s private telecommunications network ."," Nasrallah equated the government decisions with a declaration of war and mobilized Hezbollah forces, which quickly took control of parts of Beirut."," In the following days the government reversed the decisions that had sparked the outbreak of violence, and a summit attended by both factions in Qatar led to an agreement granting the Hezbollah-led opposition the veto power it had long sought."," In November 2009, after months of negotiations following National Assembly elections, the March 8 bloc agreed to form a unity government with Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri \u2019s March 14 bloc."," Tension arose in 2010, following reports that the UN Special Tribunal for Lebanon, investigating the assassination of former prime minister Rafiq al-Hariri , had focused its investigation on senior Hezbollah officials and that it would soon issue indictments."," Nasrallah condemned the tribunal as politically biased and compromised by forged evidence, and he called for the Lebanese government to stop cooperating with the investigation."," The March 14 bloc continued to support the tribunal, resulting in a tense standoff."," After attempts by Syria and Saudi Arabia to mediate between the two sides failed, Hezbollah forced the collapse of the unity government by withdrawing its two ministers and nine allied ministers from the cabinet."," In January 2011 Najib Mikati , a Sunni billionaire, was nominated to be prime minister after receiving the backing of Hezbollah and its allies in parliament."," Mikati\u2019s appointment, a sign of Hezbollah\u2019s increasing political strength, triggered protests by supporters of the March 14 bloc, who charged that the new government would be too closely aligned with Iran and Syria, Hezbollah\u2019s principal supporters."," In June 2011, after five months of deliberations, Mikati announced the formation of a new 30-member cabinet, with 18 of the posts filled by Hezbollah allies."," In late June 2011 the UN Special Tribunal for Lebanon issued arrest warrants for four suspects in the killing of Rafiq al-Hariri, who were identified by Lebanese officials as Hezbollah commanders and operatives."," In response, Nasrallah denounced the tribunal and vowed never to turn over the suspects."," A fifth suspect, also a member of Hezbollah, was identified in 2013."," In January 2014 the trial of the suspects in absentia began."," A wave of popular uprisings in early 2011, known as the Arab Spring , left Hezbollah in a difficult position."," After applauding revolutionary movements in Tunisia , Egypt , Libya , and Bahrain , the group found its interests threatened by a similar movement against a key ally, Syrian Pres."," As protests spread throughout Syria and the civilian death toll mounted, Nasrallah spoke out in support of Assad, echoing Assad\u2019s denunciations of the Syrian opposition as being agents of a foreign conspiracy ."," The conflict soon escalated into a full-blown civil war, and by late 2012 it was widely reported that Hezbollah fighters had been covertly sent to Syria to fight alongside the Syrian army."," In May 2013 Nasrallah publicly confirmed Hezbollah\u2019s involvement and vowed to fight until the rebels had been defeated."," In 2016 one of Hezbollah\u2019s most senior military commanders, Mustafa Badreddine, who was also one of the five suspects accused of planning the assassination of Rafiq al-Hariri, was killed in combat in Syria."," Role in unity government \n In late 2016 a 29-month political stalemate was ended when Hezbollah ally Michel Aoun was elected president."," As part of the deal bringing about his election, Saad al-Hariri was appointed prime minister."," A year later Hariri unexpectedly resigned while on a visit to Saudi Arabia, citing foreign involvement in Lebanon\u2019s affairs and insinuating that there was a plot against his life."," Lebanon\u2019s army and intelligence agency both denied that any such plots had been uncovered, however, and it was believed that Hariri had resigned under pressure from the Saudi government; many analysts believed Saudi Arabia was aiming to undermine Hezbollah\u2019s power."," After weeks of international pressure on the Saudi government, Hariri was allowed to return to Lebanon, where he rescinded his resignation and continued on as prime minister."," On May 6, 2018, Lebanon held its first legislative election since 2009."," The March 8 bloc received a majority of seats, making Hezbollah politically dominant for the first time."," After nine months of discussion, a unity government was announced that included most parties."," Hezbollah did not receive direct control over any major cabinet posts, since its designation as a terrorist organization by some foreign governments would threaten international funding to Lebanon."," But it did gain significant influence in the cabinet: the majority of the posts were filled by its March 8 allies, Hezbollah itself received two minor posts, and, perhaps most importantly, it was allowed to place a nonaffiliated ally to head one of the largest ministries in the country, the Ministry of Health."," The new cabinet struggled to address the crises facing Lebanon, however."," Frustration brewed over corruption in the government and over the government\u2019s inability to act effectively."," In late 2019 massive demonstrations took place across the country, calling broadly for the country\u2019s top officials to resign."," Although Hezbollah attempted to discourage protests and opposed any resignation of the government, many of its own supporters participated in the protests, and Nasrallah said the government must work to regain the protesters\u2019 confidence."," The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica \n This article was most

group the US attacked in Iraq and Syria? \n Hezbollah is one of the most important of the pro-Iranian militias in Iraq and a group with an extensive role in the Middle East."," Iraqi Shi'ite Muslim men from the Iranian-backed group Kataib Hezbollah wave the party's flags as they walk along a street painted in the colours of the Israeli flag during a parade marking the annual Quds Day, or Jerusalem Day, on the last Friday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, in Baghdad ."," On December 29, the US carried out five airstrikes against Kataib Hezbollah, an Iraqi-based Shi'ite militia that is linked to Iran and is accused of rocket attacks that killed a US contractor and wounded US soliders."," Kataib Hezbollah is one of the most important of the pro-Iranian militias in Iraq and a group with an extensive role in the Middle East, linking it to Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and operations in Syria."," Formed between 2003 and 2007 by Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis it is a creature of Iran\u2019s IRGC."," Muhandis has threatened Israel in the past and is closely linked to both the IRGC Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani and Lebanese Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah."," An Iraqi, he was born in Basra and fled to Iran in the 1980s during Saddam Hussein\u2019s crackdown on Shi\u2019ites."," He signed on to fight with Iran\u2019s IRGC and became a close colleague of Qasem Soleimani, the head of the IRGC\u2019s Quds Force."," He was linked to the military wing of Iraq\u2019s Dawa party at the same time, illustrating his influence among Iraqi Shi\u2019ites in Iran."," Michael Knight, an expert on Iraq, wrote in 2010 that Muhandis\u2019 life \u201cdescribes the arc of Iranian support for Iraqi Shi\u2019ite proxies.","\u201d He returned to Iraq after the fall of Saddam and became a member of parliament, blending his militia activities with politics."," Kataib Hezbollah was described in 2010 as a compact movement of only 400 personnel under the command of the Quds Force.","\u00a0 Muhandis was wanted for terrorism in Kuwait and also was sanctioned by the US in 2009."," The US Treasury found that Muhandis and his group threatened the peace and stability of Iraq."," As such Kataib Hezbollah was designated as a foreign terrorist organization."," Kataib was accused of receiving money from Iran through various European banks and using the money to finance attacks on Americans in the years before the US withdrawal from Iraq in 2011."," In 2014 when ISIS invaded Iraq the Shi\u2019ite cleric Ali al-Sistani issued a fatwa to raise Shi\u2019ite\u00a0 youth to fight the ISIS threat."," Kataib Hezbollah, abbreviated often as KH, became one of the groups within the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) that emerged in 2014."," Muhandis became the deputy commander of\u00a0 the PMU, illustrating his importance."," It also has affiliates in the 47th brigade, numbering some 3,000 fighters."," KH continued to be involved in extra-judicial activities, such as allegedly kidnapping a Qatari royal hunting party in 2015."," The organization also built its own parallel state structures, storing munition and holding prisoners."," In one facility south of Baghdad may hold up to 1,700 prisoners, according to a piece at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy."," A RAND report argues that it is one of the driving forces for Iranian policy in Iraq ."," Muhandis was one of the key players behind Iraq\u2019s offensive against the Kurdish Peshmerga in October 2017 after the autonomous Kurdistan region held an independence referendum."," In June 2018 a Kataib Hezbollah headquarters in Albukamal , Syria helping direct Iranian policy to aid the Assad regime and traffic weapons for Iran, was hit with an\u00a0 airstrike."," Kataib Hezbollah was allegedly behind a drone strike on Saudi Arabia on May 14, 2019 and an attack near the US Green Zone the same month."," A Kataib Hezbollah vehicle was struck in a drone strike in August 2019 near the Iraq-Syria border."," Muhandis said in September the PMU needs an air force to confront Israeli and American airstrikes."," The role of KH in Syria is one of the key threats to Israel where Iranian-backed groups from Iraq help Iran move weapons to proxies in Syria and then to Hezbollah."," He has said his forces would help Hezbollah in a future war with Israel."," \u201cI am proud of my relations with Nasrallah,\u201d he said in January 2017."," He is the leader of the resistance and an important figure in the region."," We follow his example and the example set by our brothers in Hezbollah ."," Muhandis argues that as part of the Iranian \u201cresistance\u201d he is working against the US and \u201cZionism\u201d in the region."," Kataib Hezbollah is not as large as Lebanese Hezbollah but it plays a significant role in Iraq because of its direct links to Qasem Soleimani and the PMU."," It has sought to transform the PMU into Iraq\u2019s version of the IRGC."," It has also extended its network into Syria\u00a0 to aid Iran\u2019s movement of precision guided munitions and weapons to Syria and to Hezbollah."," The decision by the US to strike at KH was taken after intelligence showed KH\u2019s role in rocket attacks going back more than six months."," It was not a decision that was likely taken lightly because Muhandis has influence and the ability to strike back at a time of his and Iran\u2019s choosing."," The five strikes on both sides of the Iran-Syria border show the extent of the KH network."," It has purposely colonized areas at Al-Qaim and Albukamal so that it can control the border crossing that is key to Iran\u2019s \u201cland bridge\u201d\u00a0 or road to the sea."," It may be central to Iran\u2019s plans to move ballistic missiles to Iraq, revealed by western intelligence services in August 2018 and December 2019."," KH\u2019s long network from Beirut to Baghdad, including its ability to strike at Saudi Arabia and Israel,

Hezbollah is that greater threat, and yes, we should go after it first and go after it before we go to war with Iraq."," Graham says Hezbollah has a global network of radical Islamic supporters, with enough operatives in the U."," \"It has a significant presence of its trained operatives inside the United States waiting for the call to action,\" says Graham."," But if we were to know that

."," \"Well, there's enormous boost for Hezbollah,\" says Blanford."," \"I mean, this was a small Arab organization that had defeated the mightiest military force the Middle East has ever seen."," With the Israelis out of Lebanon, Nasrallah encouraged, and assisted, the Palestinian uprising against Israel."," He has acknowledged sending secret agents carrying weapons to the West Bank, where he is considered a hero."," Some kids in the Gaza Strip even dress like him, down to the beard and the glasses."," At one event, a boy playing Nasrallah was flanked by one child who played a security guard, and another child dressed as a suicide bomber."," In Lebanon, where Hezbollah runs a network of schools and hospitals and participates in local elections, Nasrallah, a Muslim, is a hero even to the country's Christian President, Emile Lahoud."," \"For us Lebanese, and I can tell you a majority of Lebanese, Hezbollah is a national resistance movement,\" says Lahoud."," \"If it wasn't for them, we couldn't have liberated our land."," And because of that, we have big esteem for the Hezbollah movement."," President Lahoud has such high esteem for Hezbollah, he's ceded control of the border with Israel to them -- a border where Hezbollah and Israeli soldiers now confront each other just a few yards apart."," Hezbollah has already fired rockets across the border, and U."," officials believe that in the past two years they've been stockpiling rockets in this area hidden in caves and underground bunkers -- higher quality Iranian rockets that could reach Haifa about fifty miles away."," Openly calling for terrorism against Israel, Nasrallah is also urging on suicide operations."," \"In Palestine, these operations are the only way to root out the Zionists,\" says Nasrallah during a speech."," That's the kind of material Hezbollah broadcasts daily on its own television station, Al Manar, which reaches a worldwide audience by satellite."," Because of Washington's support for Israel, Hezbollah is conducting a ferocious propaganda offensive against the United States."," foreign policy as Satanic and shows an image of the Statue of Liberty, a skull for her face, wearing a gown dripping with the blood of other nations."," But even though he's one of the most powerful anti-American voices in the Middle East, Nasrallah says he has no use for Saddam Hussein."," provided political and military support to the Iraqi regime for decades."," We should also go after those who supported him -- like the American government."," Nasrallah has described the war on Saddam as a Satanic American-Zionist plan to dominate the Arab world."," wants to impose its political will on Iraq and wants to impose Israel's domination in the region."," Certainly these objectives are not moral objectives in my opinion."," And yet, Nasrallah has spoken out against terrorist attacks on the U."," \"We reject those methods, and believe they contradict Islam and the teachings of the Quran, which do not permit this barbarity,\" says Nasrallah."," One of those lessons is that these terrorist groups tend to do what they say they're going to do,\" says Graham."," \"If they define the United States as being Satanic - and that therefore they want to kill us - they will find ways to carry out that objective."," Is he convinced that they possess weapons of mass destruction? ."," \"But I am confident that they could possess them through their close affiliation with Iran, which has a larger warehouse of chemical and biological weapons, and is closer to gaining nuclear weapons capability than Iraq."," So if Iran wants them to have weapons of mass destruction, will they have it?

AFP/Getty Images) The pace of jihadist activity has been so intense lately that an incredibly important story has been barely reported on: ."," Two terrorists belonging to Hezbollah, a puppet of the Iranian and Syrian regimes, have been arrested for planning attacks in the U.",", with one scouting potential targets in New York including JFK International Airport."," Although the Iranian and Syrian regimes regularly organize terrorist attacks through its Hezbollah proxy, the plotting of attacks on U."," soil and on Americans overseas is very significant, but not unprecedented."," The two arrested terrorists are Ali Kourani of the Bronx, New York and Samer El-Debek of Dearborn, Michigan."," Each is a well-trained militant who belongs to Hezbollah\u2019s Islamic Jihad branch that is tasked with perpetrating terrorist attacks, preferably with some level of deniability."," Yet, under questioning, Ali Kourani explicitly told the FBI in 2016 and 2017 that he was a \u201csleeper\u201d agent of Hezbollah\u2019s Islamic Jihad carrying out \u201cblack ops\u201d for Hezbollah and \u201cthe Iranians."," His first round of training took place in Lebanon in 2000 when he was only 16-years old."," Kourani admitted to the FBI that he was accepted by Hezbollah because his family is connected to a top official in the terrorist group."," He said one of his brothers is the \u201cface of Hezbollah\u201d in Yater, Lebanon and boasted that his family\u2019s name is like the \u201cBin Laden\u2019s of Lebanon."," Shockingly, in 2003 ( two years after the 9/11 attacks ), this member of a famous terrorist family successfully entered the U."," Shortly thereafter, he applied for naturalization and became a citizen in April 2009, all the while lying about his connections to terrorism."," If his boasts are true, a simple look of his family would have tipped off the U."," Kourani predictably lied throughout his process to become a U."," citizen, including denying any plans to travel overseas when he applied to become a citizen."," Only a month after becoming a citizen, he went to Guangzhou, China, on a so-called \u201cbusiness trip\u201d to the location of a medical company that produces chemicals that can be used in bombs."," Stolen chemicals from the company were later found in the possession of Iranian terrorists in Thailand planning bombings."," In 2011, Kourani went to Lebanon for a second round of terrorism training in RPG and various firearms."," On the orders of his Hezbollah handler, he began identifying and surveilling targets."," According to the criminal complaint , his handler directed him to \u201csurveil and collet information regarding airports, including the layout of terminals, the locations of cameras and personnel, and other security features."," In response, Kourani provided detailed information to [his handler] regarding specific security protocols, baggage-screening and collection practices and the locations of surveillance cameras, security personnel, law enforcement officers and magnetometers at JFK and an international airport in another country."," Some historical context is important here: This is a revival of Iran\u2019s ambitions to target New York\u2019s JFK International Airport."," Iran already tried to carry out an attack at the airport once and was preparing to do so again."," The previous plan (in 2007) was to blow up fuel tanks and pipelines going to the airport."," The FBI confirms that one of the individuals involved in this plot had links to \u201cmilitant groups\u201d in Iran and Venezuela and had regularly contact with Iranian authorities."," There were various other Iranian links , including the involvement of an operative who was previously part of an Iran-sponsored bombing in Argentina in 1994."," Kourani also used Google Maps to research LaGuardia Airport in Queens, New York (specifically its terminals) in April 2011."," Kourani conducted surveillance on a governmental building in Manhattan with FBI offices inside; an Army National Guard office in Manhattan; an Army Armory building in Manhattan and a Secret Service office in Brooklyn."," He was also tasked with making contacts who could provide firearms to Hezbollah operatives in the U."," In addition, Hezbollah wanted Kourani to do something in Mexico and Canada."," His handler talked about possibly having him fly to one of these countries and cross into the U."," Hezbollah has ties to Latin American drug cartels, which may have something to do with the talk of a trip to Mexico."," The surveillance of targets in preparation for expected Hezbollah attacks continued until at least September 2015, as per the complaint."," Like Kourani, Samer El-Debek is a naturalized citizen who belonged to Hezbollah\u2019s Islamic Jihad branch."," He communicated via email with someone who owned a business in Iran."," El-Debek acted as an agent of the terrorist group from 2007 to September 2016, with his salary growing to over $1,000 per month plus medical expenses."," He is a specialist in bomb-making and began confessing to the FBI after Hezbollah accused him of being an American spy and detained him for four months until he falsely admitted to being one."," El-Debek was first trained in 2008 and received four rounds of training total."," One round included six days of religious teaching, where a sheikh taught about Islam\u2019s rules and \u201cmartyrdom ideology.","\u201d His explosives training focused on remotely-detonated bombs."," El-Debek was specifically taught how to make IEDs like the one Hezbollah used on a bus of Israeli tourists in Bulgaria in 2012 that killed 6 people and injured 32."," In 2009, he was sent to Thailand to dispose of bomb ingredients from a Hezbollah safehouse that they believed to have come under surveillance."," His cover was that he was traveling to Thailand for paid sex, going so far as to hire a prostitute and to have her enter the safehouse so he could try to discover any surveillance taking place."," In 2011, El-Debek flew to Colombia and entered Panama on a Hezbollah mission to identify gaps in security at the Panama Canal and the Israeli embassy."," He returned to Panama in 2012 to identify weaknesses in the Panama Canal\u2019s construction and security gaps and find out how close someone could get to a ship passing through."," embassy but did not, fearing it would compromise his mission."," Hezbollah detained El-Debek in December 2015 until April 2016, accusing him of being a U."," Based on the complaint, it appears the detention caused him to open up to the FBI during voluntary questioning (assuming his story is true)."," This is only a tiny portion of what Iran and Hezbollah is doing to try to attack targets in the U."," This is the experience of only two Hezbollah terrorists we caught."," If this is the scale of what we do know, then what horrors are being planned that we don\u2019t know about?

charged with casing John F."," Kennedy airport in New York City for a potential Hezbollah attack."," Around this same time, Samer El Debek of Dearborn, Michigan, was arrested and charged with traveling to Panama to conduct surveillance against Israeli targets and the Panama Canal."," And in February, a third man, Fadi Yassine, was arrested and charged with arranging to send weapons to a

Kourani, who admitted to being a member of Hezbollah\u2019s external operations wing, suggests something far more sinister."," Hezbollah-run charities such as the Mahdi Scouts, the Shia schools and the Martyrs Foundation are entities that supply charitable funds to the families of Hezbollah fighters and are an extension of Hezbollah into the community."," The Martyrs Foundation operates in different countries under different auspices, and in the United States its satellite was called the Goodwill Charitable Organization, based in Dearborn and responsible for funneling contributions from members and supporters directly to Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon."," Hezbollah also operates a vast fraud network, which over time has included operatives in at least ten states, including Michigan, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, New York, North Carolina and West Virginia."," It has also established businesses in the United States, including a perfume distribution company, that have served as front organizations that helped to launder money for the Shia terror group."," Another scheme involved purchasing used cars in the United States and reselling them in Africa, part of a global money laundering network that also involved the Lebanese Canadian Bank and the mingling of funds Hezbollah garnered from cocaine trafficking."," Considering all of Hezbollah\u2019s counterfeiting, smuggling and trafficking operations, among the most lucrative scams the group executed was a cigarette smuggling ring based in Charlotte, North Carolina."," Cartons of cigarettes purchased in North Carolina for $14 could be sold in Michigan for twice as much."," The group is believed to have earned tens of thousands of dollars by transporting and selling untaxed cigarettes throughout the United States."," Hezbollah has also been involved in cyber-related activities in the United States."," During the July 2006 war with Israel, Israeli hackers interrupted service on Hezbollah websites."," Hezbollah hackers responded by hijacking communication portals of companies, cable providers and web-hosting servers in south Texas; suburban Virginia; Brooklyn, New York; and New Jersey."," But Hezbollah members have not operated unmolested within the United States."," Operation Smokescreen was an FBI intelligence investigation (overseen by the Bureau\u2019s International Terrorism Operations Section) conducted in the mid-1990s that involved running sources and tapping phone lines."," For the most part, the operation was a success, and resulted in criminal charges for twenty-six individuals accused of contraband cigarette trafficking, money laundering, racketeering, wire fraud, conspiracy, visa and marriage fraud, and material support to a terrorist group."," Over 500 bank and credit card accounts were investigated as part of the financial analysis of the network."," Another undercover dragnet, Operation Bathwater , was conducted to disrupt Hezbollah activities based in Michigan and grew out of information developed in early 1999 by U."," Secret Service agents working with the Detroit Joint Terrorism Task Force."," Focused on the financial element of Hezbollah\u2019s criminal enterprise in the United States, Bathwater uncovered what was then the largest credit card fraud scheme in U."," It was run out of Toledo, Ohio, by a Dearborn resident named Ali Nasrallah."," According to a report by the Congressional Research Service, the United States has used official terrorist designations and listings to impose financial and immigration sanctions on Hezbollah and its supporters."," The United States has blocked assets under its jurisdiction, prohibited American citizens from providing the group with financial or material support or engaging in financial transactions with Hezbollah and affiliated parties, and has prohibited entry into the United States and authorization of deportation for Hezbollah associated individuals."," In addition to designating certain organizations as terrorist groups, individual members of those groups can be isolated for targeting."," Treasury Department called Assad Ahmad Barakat, Hezbollah\u2019s treasurer in South America, a key terrorist financier and someone \u201cwho has used every financial crime in the book, including his businesses, to generate funding\u201d

professed its goals were to destroy Israel and expel Western influences from Lebanon and the wider Middle East."," In 1992, Hezbollah transitioned from acting solely as a militant group fighting against Israel to an established political party in Lebanon."," Today, Hezbollah\u2019s political and military wings are both active within the country and take part in elections."," Hezbollah has a close relationship with both the Assad and Iranian regimes."," Iran provided critical support for Hezbollah\u2019s foundation and remains the group\u2019s primary patron."," During the Syrian Civil War, Hezbollah acted as one of Assad\u2019s greatest allies and provided thousands of troops for the regime."," Hezbollah is a Shia political and militant organization based in Lebanon."," In its early days, the organization was a loose collection of underground terrorist cells."," Over the last thirty years, Hezbollah has evolved into a hybrid organization woven into the structure of Lebanese society."," It provides social services and actively participates in politics, while also engaging in international terrorist attacks and regional military operations."," When Lebanon gained its independence in 1943, Shiites became an economically and politically marginalized group."," [4] After the Lebanese Civil War broke out in 1975, several Islamic revivalist movements fueled by mounting Shia discontent took root in Lebanon."," The Amal movement \u2013 from which Hezbollah would one day split \u2013 emerged during this time period and became the most prominent Shia militia during the Lebanese Civil War."," The group\u2019s objectives were to gain greater respect for Lebanon\u2019s Shia population and to increase the share of governmental resources allocated to the southern, Shia-dominated region of Lebanon."," In June 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon to counter Palestinian militants in this southern region."," [6] Some Shiites initially supported the Israeli forces because of the security they provided against Palestinian militants."," However, popular opinion against Israel began to turn as civilian death tolls rose."," In September 1982, the Israeli Defense Force was complicit in allowing a Christian Lebanese militia to massacre at least 800 Palestinian and Lebanese civilians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps."," [8] Later in 1983, an Israeli patrol accidentally crashed through a Shia festival; when observers began throwing stones, the patrol responded with gunshots and grenades, killing several in the crowd."," Following these incidents and amidst growing anti-Israeli sentiment, several Shiite Amal movement leaders broke away from the militia."," Led by Husain al-Musawi, these militants formed a new organization espousing a more militant response to the occupation, which they named Islamic Amal."," [10] The Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) was essential in supporting the formation of the Islamic Amal."," Several thousand members of the IRGC were dispatched to support Islamic Amal, and the financial backing of Iran strengthened the group."," [11] With the support of Iran, Islamic Amal quickly gained momentum by recruiting of members from other revolutionary Shia organizations, such as the Muslim Student Union and the Dawa Party of Lebanon."," [12] The group first attracted international attention with the 1983 bombings of the U."," Embassy and the American and French military barracks in Beirut."," In 1985, Islamic Amal published a manifesto under the new name of Hezbollah."," It remains unclear whether a group of Islamic Amal members split away from the lager group to form Hezbollah or whether Islamic Amal was simply an earlier iteration of Hezbollah."," [14] In the manifesto, Hezbollah outlined several of its key goals: to destroy Israel, to expel Western influences from Lebanon and the wider Middle East, and to combat enemies within Lebanon, particularly the Phalanges Party."," Hezbollah asserted that an Islamic state was the only legitimate option for the Lebanese government."," Until 1985, Hezbollah, Amal, and Palestinian guerrillas took part in resistance operations against Israel in Southern Lebanon."," From 1984 to the Israeli withdrawal in 1985, the vast majority of attacks against Israeli forces were carried out by Hezbollah."," [16] These attacks boosted the image of Hezbollah as the most prominent actor in compelling Israeli's retreat."," Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Hezbollah pursued its goal of combatting Israel and the West through militant means."," Hezbollah carried out twelve suicide attacks against Israeli forces and their allies during the occupation, in addition to a number of other military assaults."," [17] The group\u2019s attacks killed an average of twenty-five Israeli soldiers per year throughout the occupation."," [18] Groups linked to Hezbollah also kidnapped several high-profile foreigners throughout the 1980s, including American Journalist Terry Anderson and U."," During this time, Hezbollah cultivated Shia support and became the Amal movement\u2019s main competitor for the leadership of the Shia community."," While Hezbollah was the strategic ally of Iran, Amal was heavily tied to the Assad regime in Syria."," Hezbollah\u2019s more militant, anti-Israel stance led to bloody clashes with Amal from 1985 to 1989."," Colonel Higgins, for example, sparked conflict between the two groups."," Hezbollah orchestrated the kidnapping, while Amal opposed the operation."," It was in favor of maintaining a stable relationship with the U.",", which would be complicated by the kidnaping of American servicemen."," Amal attempted and failed to free Higgins, resulting in renewed clashes between Hezbollah and Amal."," From 1985 through the 1990s, Hezbollah also maintained an active global presence."," A specific branch of Hezbollah, the External Security Organization (also known as the Islamic Jihad Organization or the External Services Organization), was responsible for planning and executing attacks outside of Lebanon."," In 1985, members of this branch hijacked TWA Flight 847 from Cairo to Athens."," Hezbollah militants held hostages from the flight for weeks and killed one passenger to draw attention to the Lebanese prisoners held in Israel."," [21] After the Israeli government released 300 Lebanese prisoners, the hijackers freed the remaining hostages."," [22] In March 1992, Hezbollah operatives carried out a truck bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, killing twenty-nine and wounding hundreds."," In July 1994, the group was accused of bombing the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association, which killed nearly 100 and wounded more than 200."," [23] In June 1996, the group bombed the American Khobar Towers housing complex in Saudi Arabia, killing 19."," In addition to Hezbollah\u2019s militant agenda both abroad and at home, the group also invested in the social landscape of southern Lebanon."," Shia groups in the region had a history of providing social services to the local population."," Hezbollah was among the most professional and extensive providers of these services, handling projects from infrastructure construction to health care."," After the civil war, Hezbollah continued its day-to-day social service efforts and provided assistance in times of crises."," For example, the group rebuilt the homes and businesses of Christian families returning to southern Beirut after the war."," [25] Hezbollah also led the reconstruction process after a 1996 Israeli bombing campaign in southern Lebanon, reportedly rebuilding 5,000 homes and repairing roads and infrastructure."," The group claimed to have provided compensation to 2,300 farmers in the area."," In 1989, Hezbollah embraced a shift in ideology and tactics.","\u00a0The 1989 Taif Agreement, which ended the Lebanese Civil War, opened the door for Hezbollah to join the Lebanese political process as an official party."," The transition from militancy to politics was favored both by Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyid Abbas al Musawi and by Iranian president Hashimi Rafsanjani."," [27] Hezbollah competed in its first Lebanese national elections in 1992 and won eight seats in Parliament."," Hezbollah also participated in national elections in 1996, 2000, 2005, 2009, and 2018."," Throughout its time as a political party, Hezbollah has often been at odds with the sitting Lebanese government."," After the 2005 elections, Hezbollah strongly opposed the American- and Saudi-backed government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora."," In December 2006, in an attempt to force the sitting government to resign, it led the opposition in a sit-in that resulted in eighteen months of political deadlock."," [28] Tensions between the group and national government erupted again in May 2008, when the government announced a plan to shut down Hezbollah\u2019s private telecommunications network."," Violence broke out between government supporters and Hezbollah on the streets of Beirut, while the Lebanese army largely sat out the conflict."," Within days, Hezbollah and its supporters had taken over parts of Beirut."," Speculation that the violence would lead to a coup was quelled when the Arab League brokered a settlement between the government and Hezbollah."," [29] The settlement, called the Doha Agreement, granted Hezbollah veto power in the government and pledged that no political group would use weapons for within-country disputes."," Though Hezbollah had become a mainstream political party, it also continued to carry out terrorist attacks against Israeli forces."," [31] Israel\u2019s departure in 2000 was widely attributed to Hezbollah, increasing the group\u2019s popularity amongst the Lebanese population."," [32] \u00a0 After a period of relative calm from 2000 to 2006, the group kidnapped two Israeli soldiers and killed eight others in July 2006."," [33] The war killed both civilians and combatants; 164 Israelis died, and over 1,125 Lebanese perished, most of whom were civilians."," [34] Supporters lauded Hezbollah\u2019s endurance and supposed victory against Israel, while others accused the organization of instigating an unnecessary and highly destructive war."," Following the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, Hezbollah began supporting anti-American forces in the region by establishing Unit 3800."," According to American intelligence, Unit 3800 was a specialized branch of Hezbollah which exclusively trained and supported Iraqi Shia militant groups targeting American forces."," [36] Unit 3800 also supplied Shia militants with funds and weapons."," These Hezbollah-sponsored groups were instrumental in planning several attacks in Iraq, including the 2007 attack on the Karbala Joint Coordination Center which caused deaths of five Americans."," [37] Later in 2014, Hezbollah also provided resources to Iraqi groups in their fight against the Islamic State."," In 2011, Hezbollah began sending military advisors to aid the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria\u2019s increasingly bloody civil war."," In June 2013, Hezbollah officials confirmed that the organization had also deployed combat forces to fight alongside Assad\u2019s troops, Russian forces, and other allied Shia organizations."," Assad has served as a vital regional ally to Hezbollah, and the group leadership believed that maintaining Assad\u2019s hold over Syria was necessary to prevent Israeli forces from re-entering Lebanon."," [39] Another critical goal included preserving and expanding group\u2019s access to Syrian territory, as this land provided routes for transporting Iranian missile parts and weapons."," At first, Hezbollah forces in Syria were mainly concentrated in the city of al-Qusayr on the border of Syria and Lebanon."," However, by 2015, Hezbollah operations had spread to other areas of Syria, including in the northwest cities of Idlib and Aleppo, in the south near Daraa, and even in the central and eastern parts of the country."," [41] Hezbollah played a critical role in the Aleppo Offensive in late 2016, assisting Assad forces in retaking control of the city."," [42] Beyond sending Lebanese militants to fight in the Syrian Civil War, Hezbollah also trained and organized Syrian Shia militias and recruited thousands of foreign fighters."," [43] The Assad regime regained some of its influence in Syria, and it reasserted control over many Shia militias by 2017."," Throughout the war, Hezbollah fought alongside both Iranian and Russian troops as well as other pro-Assad militant groups."," Hezbollah militias were considered the most professional and effective fighting force in the country."," The group\u2019s most common opponents were the Islamic State, Jabhat al-Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham, and elements of the Free Syrian Army."," Hezbollah leaders decided to bring much of its personnel home."," However, a number of Hezbollah troops remained stationed near Damascus, in Deir al-Zour, and throughout southern Syria."," Though Hezbollah militias were very effective in the Syrian Civil War, they suffered serious casualties."," Of the 7,000-10,000 Hezbollah troops deployed to Syria, 1,600-2,000 were estimated to have died in action."," [47] Based on these estimates, more Hezbollah fighters died in Syria than during the eighteen year Israeli occupation of Lebanon."," [48] Additionally, several top Hezbollah commanders, such as Abu Jaafar and Ali Fayyad, were killed while serving in Syria."," In addition to these causalities, Hezbollah\u2019s reputation also suffered from the group\u2019s participation in the Syrian Civil War."," Hezbollah was once considered one of the most popular sub-state Arab movements in the region, winning support from both Shiites and Sunnis."," However, Hezbollah\u2019s support for the Assad regime has alienated much of the Middle East\u2019s Sunni population."," [50] \u00a0 The group\u2019s participation in the war has helped to fuel the radicalization of Sunni populations in Tripoli and near the northern Lebanon-Syria border."," [51] This growing unpopularity is believed to have been a key factor behind the decisions by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the Arab League, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization in the spring of 2016."," Despite its consequences, the war in Syria greatly increased Hezbollah\u2019s fighting capabilities and weapons stockpile."," The group has received significant amounts of high tech military equipment and weaponry from Russia and Iran."," [53] Hezbollah militants have also gained experience fighting other non-state actors, such as the Islamic State, and operating in dense urban environments."," [54] Additionally, reports suggest that the group\u2019s recruiting capabilities in Lebanon have expanded significantly since 2011 as a result of Hezbollah\u2019s participation in the civil war."," Since 2014, Hezbollah has also sent militants and resources to support Houthi insurgents in the Yemeni Civil War."," Initially, Hezbollah primary activities in the civil war were transferring funds and training insurgents."," [56] As the war progressed, Hezbollah began sending militants to the region to support the Houthi militants."," In 2018, eight Hezbollah members were killed in northwest Yemen, a stronghold of the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels."," During the Syrian Civil War, Hezbollah\u2019s attention was largely diverted away from Israel."," In 2018, Assad forces regained control of the Syrian-administered portion of the Golan Heights, a region bordering Israeli-occupied territory."," After Assad\u2019s victory, Hezbollah began establishing cells and militias in the region."," [58] The group has located substantial weapons and rockets in Golan Heights neighborhoods in close proximity to Israeli-controlled territory."," It has also recruited hundreds of local Syrian men to form new militias."," Since 2019, Hezbollah has faced severe financial constraints."," American sanctions on Iran \u2013 Hezbollah\u2019s primary patron \u2013 considerably affected Iran\u2019s ability to finance the group."," As a result, Hezbollah has shut many offices around the country and cut the pay of its employees and militants."," [60] The continuation of Americans sanctions may create more serious obstacles for

York Times ."],[" Hezbollah: The World\u2019s Leading Narco-Terrorist Organization - Center for Security Policy ."," Hezbollah: The World\u2019s Leading Narco-Terrorist Organization ."," Hezbollah (Party of God) has long been known as a Jihadist terrorist organization of global reach."," They have conducted operations throughout the Middle East, in Thailand, Bulgaria, Argentina, and elsewhere in Europe and Latin America."," Hezbollah has also conducted operations in Canada and the United States."," Hezbollah has become notorious since the early 1980s for its repeated terror attacks, including the Marine Barracks bombing on 23 October 1983 which killed 241 soldiers, sailors and Marines on peacekeeping duty in Lebanon."," But that was far from the only Hezbollah operation targeting Americans."," In the late 1980s Hezbollah and allies of Hezbollah under their protection kidnapped Americans and other Westerners in Beirut, including Marine Lieutenant Colonel William Higgins, who they subsequently murdered in captivity."," Also kidnapped and murdered by Hezbollah was William Buckley, the CIA station chief at the US embassy in Beirut."," Many Americans are not aware, however, that Hezbollah continued to target Americans in more recent times, with Hezbollah operatives directly involved in fighting US GIs in Iraq during the insurgency."," \u00a0 In addition to its Jihadist operations, Hezbollah has a global network of illicit operations to fund itself."," Its activities are the same as those of organized crime syndicates around the world: arms trading, drug smuggling, human trafficking, bootlegging and other forms of criminal activity."," Evidence of Hezbollah\u2019s criminal activities has been documented for years, both by analysts and through counterterror and counternarcotics operations conducted by US and allied law enforcement."," In fact, an overview of Hezbollah\u2019s criminal activity makes it seem as if Jihad is just a sideline for a global Mafia-like Islamic organization using every kind of illegal activity imaginable to make money."," Particularly with regard to the US, Hezbollah has avoided violent jihad attacks, probably to avoid massive US retaliation on its home turf in Lebanon, in favor of activities centered around drug trafficking, criminal schemes and scams, which have been going on for decades."," For example, Operation Smokescreen, conducted from 1995-2002, broke up a Hezbollah cell in Charlotte, North Carolina that was bootlegging cigarettes to raise money."," This was detailed in the excellent book Lightning Out of Lebanon ."," \u00a0 In 2013, in Operation Tobacco Road , 16 men in the US were indicted for trafficking bootleg cigarettes, the proceeds of which, according to then-NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly, went to Hezbollah and/or HAMAS."," In 2011, Lebanese Canadian Bank and other Lebanon-based financial institutions were implicated in a massive money laundering scheme that involved the sale of used cars into West Africa from some 70 US car dealerships."," The scheme is thought to have raised $480 million for Hezbollah."," In early 2015, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), working in cooperation with European authorities, launched Operation Cedar, targeting a Hezbollah money laundering network operating with drug cartels in South America, Europe and the Middle East ."," Operation Cedar was part of a longer, wider law enforcement effort known as Project Cassandra to disrupt Hezbollah\u2019s joint ventures with drug cartels."," The scheme worked this way: Hezbollah garnered proceeds from cocaine sales in Europe and purchased expensive luxury goods to be resold back home in Lebanon."," The profits from the sale of those goods was split between the cartels in South America that supplied the cocaine and the purchase of weaponry for Hezbollah."," Fourteen defendants have been charged in Germany for this narco-terror activity."," Hezbollah\u2019s involvement with drug cartels gained the attention of some in the US Congress."," Ted Budd, R-NC, introduced the Hezbollah Kingpin Designation Act which would have resulted in broader sanctions against anyone associated with Hezbollah."," Unfortunately, the bill, like so many other promising ideas and needed initiatives, died in the US Congress."," Of course, Hezbollah is not totally dependent on criminal activity for its funding."," Iran has provided funding for Hezbollah since its inception and Hezbollah essentially operates as an arm of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)."," Additionally, Hezbollah receives an undisclosed amount of funding each year in the form of zakat, an obligatory tax mandated by sharia."," \u201cHundreds of thousands of Shiites in Lebanon and around the globe, who strictly adhere to this duty, pay such amounts on a yearly basis."," Hezbollah receives considerable sums from these \u2018legal rights or alms\u2019, as they are known."," \u00a0 This suggests that Hezbollah\u2019s criminal activity is driven not so much by need but by raw greed and the opportunities to inflict harm on enemies afforded by association with organized crime and narco-traffickers."," In other words, in addition to being a Jihadist terror organization, Hezbollah is a gang of thugs and outlaws."," Hezbollah\u2019s terror and criminal activity have global reach, with reports of activity stretching from their home base in Lebanon to Thailand and the Philippines to the east and Europe, Latin America and the United States and Canada to the west."," It is Hezbollah\u2019s Latin American operations that are particularly concerning to US observers, largely due to our undefended southern border."," An example of Hezbollah\u2019s Latin American presence was driven home in the late summer of 2018 when Brazilian police, acting on intelligence from US authorities, arrested Assad Ahmad Barakat, a major Hezbollah lieutenant."," Barakat was based in the notoriously lawless Tri-Border Region where Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina border each other."," According to The Globe and Mail, the Tri-Border region has long been a \u201chaven for smugglers, traffickers and counterfeiters.","\u201d And since the influx of Middle Eastern immigrants starting in the 1970s, it has also become a \u201credoubt for terrorism support and financing."," The Globe and Mail\u00a0 reports that the US Treasury believes that Barakat has used his businesses in the Tri-Border Area as a front for fundraising for Hezbollah, as well as coercing local shopkeepers into giving money to the organization."," A Treasury official said Barakat used \u2018every financial crime in the book\u201d to fund Hezbollah and \u2018underwrite terror."," Hezbollah\u2019s major presence in Venezuela is a particularly timely topic."," Not surprisingly, Hezbollah\u2019s operations there are characterized by criminal activity and interaction with Venezuela\u2019s Iranian allies, who also have had a significant presence there."," Hezbollah\u2019s support network in Venezuela dates back to the 1990s."," It\u2019s center of gravity in the country is on Margarita Island, with its thousands of Middle Eastern immigrants."," Conveniently, the island is a prime location for the drug traffickers with whom Hezbollah has such a close relationship."," Some of the members of the Charlotte, North Carolina Hezbollah cell and bootlegging outfit taken down in the previously mentioned Operation Smokescreen came from Venezuela."," Naturally, for years, due to the hostility of the socialist regimes in power in Caracas, as well as their close ties to Iran, US officials have long been concerned about Venezuela being a gateway from the Middle East to the Western Hemisphere."," Hezbollah works the connection between narco-trafficking in Latin America and Africa, one of the busiest drug smuggling thoroughfares in the world."," This route is the means by which most cocaine finds its way into Europe."," It is also a lucrative means of financing for Hezbollah and other Jihadist groups."," According to the US State Department, cocaine from Latin America, including\u00a0 Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela passes through the African nation of Guinea-Bissau into southern Europe."," Interpol and the United Nations both report that at least a portion of this trade involves Hezbollah."," Those reports indicate that a considerable portion of Hezbollah\u2019s income comes from cocaine traded through West Africa."," The Lebanese expatriate community in both South America and West Africa provide a seamless connection to facilitate the drug trade."," Hezbollah\u2019s support network in the Lebanese expatriate community is one of the keys to its prominence in the narco-trafficking world."," Latin American drug kingpins have come to depend on Hezbollah, particularly in the African pipeline into Europe."," Lebanese merchants and cargo aggregators use their otherwise legitimate logistical infrastructure to facilitate the movement of drugs."," Hezbollah\u2019s role in drug smuggling has not escaped the attention of U."," In 2009, Michael Braun, then the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s Special Operations Division, testified before Congress that members of Hezbollah were \u201crubbing shoulders with Latin American and Mexican drug cartels.","\u201d Braun described this alliance of Jihadists and drug traffickers as \u201chybrid terrorist organizations meaner and uglier than anything law enforcement or militaries have ever faced."," law enforcement agencies have in fact targeted Hezbollah\u2019s narco-terror activities."," Treasury Department blacklisted Lebanese drug trafficker and Hezbollah supporter Ayman Joumma along with nine of his associates and nineteen businesses that made up his trafficking and money laundering operations."," Joumma\u2019s operations spanned the globe, including Panama and Colombia."," There is almost no country in the Western Hemisphere that hasn\u2019t been infested by Hezbollah, which means that their narco-trafficking is as widespread as any of the known cartels."," Among the nations in which Hezbollah has operated are Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Panama, Venezuela, Mexico, Canada, Chile, Paraguay, Curacao, Uruguay and, of course, the United States."," Hezbollah\u2019s involvement in these activities is triply dangerous for America and its allies."," First of all, Hezbollah\u2019s drug smuggling and other trafficking activities allow the organization to build up tremendous wealth which it can then use to wage its brand of global jihad."," Secondly, Hezbollah\u2019s vast network and terrorist experience poses a great danger to our law enforcement agencies in the form of weapons and methods gained from experience in terror operations in the Middle East and elsewhere."," Finally, Hezbollah\u2019s operations in both illegal and seemingly legitimate global businesses has allowed the organization to create a footprint unrivaled in the jihadist movement."," Should Hezbollah choose to go kinetic, they are capable of targeting Americans and U."," [2]

the renewed relations between Iran and Hamas."," With the help of Hezbollah, Iran has managed to take control of large parts of Syria."," Now that the Iranians have sole control over Lebanon, their eyes are set on the Gaza Strip."," They know that the only way to access the Gaza Strip is through the Hamas door."," Hamas knows that it will have to pay a price: allowing Iran and Hezbollah to set foot in the Gaza Strip."," Judging from the remarks of Abu Marzouk, Hamas appears to be happy to pay the price."," Hariri, Abbas and many Sunni Arab countries, such as Saudi Arabia, felt betrayed by the Obama Administration's policy of d\u00c3\u00a9tente towards Iran -- a policy that emboldened the Iranians and gave them a green light to meddle in the internal affairs of Arab countries to try to establish, as they seem to have done, a \"Shiite Crescent\" from Persia through Yemen and now Lebanon, clear to the Mediterranean Sea."," The Sunni Arabs are apparently particularly worried about the nuclear deal signed between the Obama Administration and Iran."," They feel that the Obama Administration's attempt to appease the Iranians has emboldened the country that is the world's leading sponsor of terrorism."," Iran has since taken advantage of the nuclear deal to threaten and try to terrorize America, its friends and its Arab allies."," Abbas has multiple reasons to be worried about the Hamas-Hezbollah alliance."," Here is another one: a recent meeting in Beirut between Hamas leader Saleh Arouri and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was yet another sign of Hamas's effort to pave the way for Iran and Hezbollah to infiltrate the Gaza Strip and meddle in the internal affairs of the Palestinians."," A recent meeting in Beirut between Hamas leader Saleh Arouri (left) and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah (right) was another sign of Hamas's effort to pave the way for Iran and Hezbollah to infiltrate the Gaza Strip."," Hamas has already stated repeatedly that it has absolutely no intention of laying down its weapons as promised for the \"reconciliation\" agreement with the Palestinian Authority."," Hamas is prepared to cede to PA President Mahmoud Abbas limited civilian control of the Gaza Strip, but has been clear that it will never dismantle its security apparatus or military wing."," Hamas wants to bring the Iranians and Hezbollah into the Gaza Strip to counterbalance pressure from Abbas and Egypt and other countries to disarm and hand control over to Abbas."," If Abbas ever returns to the Gaza Strip, he will find himself sitting not only with Hamas, but also with Iran and Hezbollah, who consider him a traitor and puppet in the hands of Israel and the US."," Alarmed by the rapprochement between Hamas and Hezbollah and Iran, Saudi Arabia earlier this week summoned Abbas for urgent talks in Riyadh."," The Saudis have been following with concern the visits by Hamas leaders to Iran and Hezbollah, and are worried that Abbas may face the same fate as Hariri."," Abbas may well wish to steer clear of the Gaza Strip: Iran and Hezbollah are working with Hamas to establish a \"joint front\" against Israel."," Hamas's decision to tilt towards Iran and Hezbollah discloses the truth: it is not headed towards moderation and pragmatism, but the very opposite."," This does not bode well for the current Trump Administration's efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East."," Without stopping Iran and Hezbollah from spreading their influence and control to the Gaza Strip and Arab countries, the prospects of peace seem rather dim."," In fact, the prospects of war seem pretty close, as Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad meet in the middle to discuss their plans for war against Israel."," Failing to stop Iran and Hezbollah

Transform Cyberterrorism \u2013 Georgetown Security Studies Review ."," A Publication of the Georgetown University Center for Security Studies ."," The Cyber Party of God: How Hezbollah Could Transform Cyberterrorism \n By Ben Schaefer Posted on March 11, 2018 July 22, 2019 ."," Since 1982, Hezbollah, the Lebanese \u201cParty of God\u201d and Iran-backed Shiite terrorist organization, has antagonized its enemies through a potent mix of armed attacks and psychological warfare."," Among these tactics, Hezbollah pioneered the use of cyber-operations as a tool of coercion over a decade ago and continues to use the Internet as a weapon today."," Inspired and refined with the help of Iran, Hezbollah is shifting its coercive tactics from urban streets and battlefields to the routers of their Western adversaries."," Hezbollah formed during the Israeli occupation of Lebanon in 1982 and is credited as a factor in Israel\u2019s withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000."," [i] The group\u2019s success can be attributed\u2014at least in part\u2014to substantial financial backing from Iran, which donated more money to Hezbollah than to any other foreign militia group."," [ii] Iran\u2019s backing has allowed Hezbollah to develop a force of as many as 30,000 fighters, [iii] as well as an advanced psychological operations capability through its broadcast station and media wing, Al-Manar."," [iv] In return, Iran gained a stalwart ally in the Arabic-speaking Middle East, and a conduit for subversive tactics that Tehran can plausibly deny."," Through its significant resource base, Hezbollah has produced an advanced technical capability that allows the group to use the Internet to accomplish significant strategic objectives."," [vi] In 2006, during the 34-day Israel-Hezbollah War, Hezbollah launched sophisticated cyber-attacks against websites in multiple countries that supported Israel, including targets in the United States."," [vii] These attacks focused on spreading Hezbollah\u2019s propaganda, but also compromised legitimate websites to give Hezbollah supporters a means of providing financial donations to the group."," More recently, in 2015, Hezbollah infiltrated both private and public entities in Israel\u2019s defense sector in an attack known as \u201cVolatile Cedar.","\u201d [ix] The initial report describing the breach, distributed by the Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point, does not directly implicate Hezbollah; [x] however, based on the targets, operational methods, and resources required, the attack has generally been attributed to the group."," [xi] If the assessment proves accurate, Volatile Cedar demonstrates a significant cyber capability by a non-state actor."," In fact, Hezbollah has benefited in cyberspace from its ties to Iran, an advantage not available to most other terrorist groups."," After Iran suffered a blow to its nuclear test facilities by the Stuxnet virus in 2010, it greatly increased research and development efforts for its own cyber abilities."," [xiii] A report by the British Technology firm Small Media indicates that in 2015, Tehran had increased its spending on cybersecurity by 1,200 percent in a mere two-year period, [xiv] and allowed Tehran to ascend to the top-tier of cyber threats against the United States in 2018."," As Tehran\u2019s favored proxy-militia, Hezbollah has already received tools and training from Iran."," [xvi] Further, because Hezbollah provides Iran with a measure of plausible deniability in regional meddling, Iran will likely continue to use its Lebanese cyber-warriors for everything from espionage, as \u201cVolatile Cedar\u201d could indicate, to offensive operations like large-scale Distributed Denial of Service attacks against financial institutions in countries like Israel and Saudi Arabia."," Hezbollah\u2019s capabilities could indicate a broader shift in cyberterrorism."," The group has often been at the forefront of using new tactics and methods as tools of coercion and inspires other terrorist organizations to follow its lead."," For example, in the 1980\u2019s, Hezbollah pioneered the use of suicide tactics as a means of gaining an advantage over the better resourced Israeli Defense Forces."," [xvii] This tactic proved so effective that suicide bombing remains a common weapon in many terrorists\u2019 arsenals to this day."," As Hezbollah\u2019s cyber capabilities grow stronger and more successes are noted, other terrorist groups may adopt similar techniques."," Hezbollah\u2019s cyber capabilities demonstrate that non-state actors can undertake Internet operations commensurate to their nation-state counterparts."," The group has a proven track record of developing tactics ahead of their time, and its advanced use of cyber operations should be treated no differently."," Cyberterrorism now poses a greater threat to the West than ever before, and Hezbollah could be the harbinger of a new wave of Internet terrorists."," [i] \u201cProfile: Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah Movement,\u201d BBC , March 15, 2016, http://www."," [ii] Casey Addis and Christopher Blanchard,

translations for the word Kataib in Arabic, but the group is often called the Hezbollah Brigades."," Smyth, who studies Shiite militias, said Kataib Hezbollah is closely connected to Iran, Iraq\u2019s next-door neighbor to the east; and it is one of the country\u2019s most loyal proxies in Iraq."," Kataib Hezbollah, strongly connected to the Lebanese Hezbollah, formed around 2007 ."," Then, slowly,

Smyth said since the US-led overthrow of Hussein, the Iranians have courted the Shiites in Iraq as their natural allies."," \u201cThere is no social services, there is no other services, there is

the 2006 War | HRW ."," Civilians under Assault \n Hezbollah\u2019s Rocket Attacks on Israel in the 2006 War ."," Northern Israel,\nshowing locations struck by Hezbollah rockets that are described in this report."," During its armed conflict with Israel\nfrom July 12 until August 14, 2006, Hezbollah claimed at various times that its\nrockets were aimed primarily at military targets in Israel,\nor that its attacks on civilians were justifiable as a response to Israel's indiscriminate fire into southern Lebanon and as a tool to draw Israel into a ground war."," In fact,\nthe former claim is refuted by the large number of rockets that hit civilian\nobjects far removed from any military targets, whereas the latter arguments are\ninadmissible under international humanitarian law."," Hezbollah forces in Lebanon\nfired thousands of rockets into Israel,\ncausing civilian casualties and damage to civilian structures."," Hezbollah's\nmeans of attack relied on unguided weapons that had no capacity to hit military\ntargets with any precision."," It repeatedly bombarded cities, towns, and villages\nwithout any apparent effort to distinguish between civilians and military\nobjectives."," In doing so, Hezbollah, as a party to an armed conflict governed by\ninternational humanitarian law, violated fundamental prohibitions against\ndeliberate and indiscriminate attacks against civilians."," This report focuses on Hezbollah's rocket attacks on Israel.","\nIt is based on on-site research and a review of documentary evidence."," We have\naddressed other aspects of the conflict-including violations by Israel\nin its conduct of hostilities-in other reports."," We will be addressing\nadditional aspects of the conflict, including allegations that Hezbollah\nrepeatedly used civilian \"shields,\" in a forthcoming report, Why They Died:\nCivilian Deaths in Lebanon\nduring the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War ."," At all times, we seek to measure each\nparty's compliance with its obligations under the laws of war, rather than\nmeasure it against the conduct of the other party."," To criticize one party for\nviolating international humanitarian law does not excuse or mitigate the\nviolations committed by the other party."," Hezbollah rockets killed 43 civilians and 12 soldiers inside\nIsrael\nduring the course of the 34-day conflict."," [1] \nThirty-three civilians suffered serious physical injuries, 68 suffered moderate\nphysical injuries, and 1,388 suffered light physical injuries, according to\nofficial Israeli statistics."," Hospitals also treated 2,773 civilians for shock\nand anxiety."," Rockets killed and injured Israelis in their homes and\nworkplaces, and on the streets of villages and cities."," Rockets struck hospitals\nin Nahariya, Safed, and Mazra, an elementary school in Kiryat Yam, and a post\noffice in Haifa.","\nSuch attacks on civilians and civilian structures were often the foreseeable\nconsequence of Hezbollah's attacks, and, as its statements indicate, were at\ntimes intended."," Israeli authorities acknowledged that Hezbollah was\ntargeting military objects in northern Israel part of the time."," However,\nciting national security, they have not disclosed details of such attacks or\nallowed independent monitors to visit those locations."," We thus cannot say with\ncertainty how often Hezbollah rocket attacks hit military targets or landed in\nthe near vicinity of such targets, or how the number of such attacks compares\nwith the number of rockets that hit civilian areas."," However, the legality of attacks under international\nhumanitarian law must be measured attack by attack, so the fact that some\nattacks may have hit military targets does not in itself justify other attacks\nthat did not.","\nIn some of those cases, we could find no evidence there had been a legitimate\nmilitary target in the vicinity at the time of the attack, suggesting it was a\ndeliberate attack on civilians."," In other cases, we found that there had been a\nmilitary object in the vicinity but, even assuming Hezbollah had been intending\nto hit the military target instead of civilians, the unguided rockets it used\nwas incapable of distinguishing between the two."," At the time of attack,\nHezbollah also failed to take all feasible precautions to minimize loss of\ncivilian life, such as by issuing \"effective advance warning ."," Based on an assessment of numerous declarations and 89\nwartime communiqus issued by Hezbollah about its attacks in Israel, we also\nconclude that, although Hezbollah leaders and spokesmen often expressed support\nfor the principle of sparing civilians on both sides from attack, they both\nrepeatedly threatened to attack Israeli towns and settlements and claimed\nresponsibility for specific attacks on Israeli towns and settlements, alongside\nthe claims they made of hitting specific military targets inside Israel.","\nHezbollah's attacks in violation of the laws of war, when combined with such\nstatements indicating criminal intent, is strong evidence that some Hezbollah\nmembers and commanders were responsible for war crimes."," This report focuses on the extent to which Hezbollah\ntargeted or indiscriminately fired its rockets toward civilians and civilian\nobjects, and the injuries and deaths they caused."," It does not address other\neffects of Hezbollah's rocket campaign, such as the dislocation of population,\nthe cost of lost workdays, interrupted economic activity, and damage to the\nbuilt and natural environment."," Human Rights Watch has published a number of reports and\nstatements related to violations of the laws of war by parties to the\nIsrael-Hezbollah conflict of 2006, all of them available at www."," These\ninclude Fatal Strikes: Israel's Indiscriminate Attacks against Civilians in\nLebanon (2006), \"Hezbollah Must End Attacks on Civilians,\" (August 5,\n2006), and \"Hezbollah Rocket Attacks on Haifa Designed to Kill Civilians\" (July\n18, 2006)."," We have also issued reports on prior armed conflicts between\nIsrael\nand Hezbollah, including Operation Grapes of Wrath: The Civilian Victims \n(1997) and Civilian Pawns: Laws of War Violations and the Use of Weapons on\nthe Israel-Lebanon Border (1996)."," At this writing, we were also completing\nthe above-mentioned Why They Died: Civilian Deaths in Lebanon during the\n2006 Israel-Hezbollah War and a separate report on Israel's use of cluster munitions."," Our research during 2006 concluded that the IDF attacks\nresponsible for a majority of the civilian deaths in Lebanon were indiscriminate; that\nis, they failed to distinguish between civilian and military targets."," Many of\nthe attacks in which civilians died took place at times when there was no\nevidence that Hezbollah fighters or weapons were in the vicinity, despite IDF\nclaims that the high proportion of civilian deaths in Lebanon was due to Hezbollah hiding\nits rockets and fighters in villages and towns."," While the IDF often warned\ncivilians to evacuate areas in southern Lebanon, it then acted in many\ncases as if its warnings gave it license to treat all persons who did not flee\nas combatants."," In southern Lebanon, many people remained even after warnings\nbecause of age, infirmity, responsibility for livestock and crops, inability to\nafford exorbitant taxi fares charged for evacuation, or fear of becoming\nanother roadside casualty of IDF bombing."," Thus, the IDF's indiscriminate\nbombardments had devastating consequences for civilians."," [3] \nIn addition, Israel\nindiscriminately and extensively bombarded Lebanon with cluster munitions,\nwhich left behind as many as one million hazardous duds that, as of June 20,\n2007, had resulted in 24 civilian deaths and 183 injuries, according to the\nUnited Nations Mine Action Coordination Center South Lebanon."," [4] \nIn other cases, Israel\ndeliberately targeted civilians merely because of their political or social\nassociation with Hezbollah, despite the fact that there is no evidence that\nthese civilians were actively participating in hostilities."," After initially\nclaiming otherwise, Hezbollah quickly acknowledged that it was targeting\nIsraeli towns and cities, but claimed it had no other means to compel Israel\nto cease its attacks on Lebanese civilians."," The Geneva Conventions state\nexplicitly that violations perpetrated by one party, no matter how grave, do\nnot release the other party from its obligations to abide by that law."," [5] And while belligerent reprisals are permitted in\ncertain narrowly defined circumstances during armed conflicts between states,\nthey are never permitted against civilians."," [6] Parties to a non-international armed conflict\nhave no right to resort to belligerent reprisals of any kind."," Hezbollah also advanced another justification for firing\nrockets into Israel: to\ncompel Israel to mount a\nground offensive in Lebanon,\nthereby giving Hezbollah certain fighting advantages it lacked when facing a\nwar from the air."," Whatever the merits such a claim might have had if Hezbollah\nhad aimed only at military targets using precise weapons (e.",", sniper fire\nacross the border targeting soldiers), it cannot be used to justify\nindiscriminate or direct attacks on civilians."," International humanitarian law\nrequires that, regardless of the purpose, attacks may be carried out only\nagainst military objectives, defined as persons, objects or places whose\nnature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military\naction, and whose destruction at that time offers a definite military\nadvantage."," A military rationale for an attack on civilians does not transform\nthose targeted into a valid military objective; they remain immune from attack\nunder the laws of war."," Another contention is that Hezbollah rocket attacks on towns\nand villages in northern Israel\nwere not indiscriminate because most Israeli civilians within their range had\neither fled to other parts of the country or were beyond reach in reinforced\nshelters or \"safe rooms\" in their homes."," According to this view, the firing of\nunguided rockets toward Israel\nshould not be considered indiscriminate because of the reduced numbers of\nat-risk civilians."," (A similar argument is made by those who contend that\nindiscriminate Israeli fire into southern Lebanon during the war was\npermissible because the civilian population had either fled or should have fled\nbecause of Israeli government warnings."," The claim is problematic both as a statement of fact and as\na matter of law."," While many residents of northern Israel did flee or descend into\nshelters, towns and cities were not empty of civilians."," A sizable population\nchose to stay, for a variety of reasons."," Some had no place to flee to or could\nnot afford to pay for lodgings elsewhere, or chose not to abandon their homes,\ntheir work, or relatives who themselves chose to stay."," In addition, relatively\nfew residents of Arab communities in northern Israel fled the region or had\naccess to shelters or safe rooms."," Even if a party to a conflict has issued warnings to\ncivilians to flee, or even if some or most civilians have fled or found safety,\nhumanitarian law prohibits a warring party from treating an area as a free-fire\nzone when civilians remain for whatever reason."," The party must continue to take\nprecautions to spare the civilians and refrain from indiscriminate attacks."," Nor should Hezbollah's public declarations promising further\nattacks on Israeli towns be considered the types of warnings that international\nhumanitarian law encourages warring parties to make before attacks that may\naffect the civilian population."," [8] \nThe purpose of proper warnings is to enable civilians to take shelter or leave\nthe area."," To be effective, warnings must be timely and sufficiently specific\nand comprehensible to allow such action."," An ostensible warning that is too\nvague or inaccurate to actually help protect civilians, but is primarily\nintended to generate broader panic and fear, would be unlawful, even if the\nattack is never carried out."," In accordance with its institutional mandate, Human Rights\nWatch is neutral on matters concerning the legitimacy of resorting to war."," We\nconsider this neutrality to be the most effective way to promote our primary\ngoal of encouraging all parties to armed conflict to respect international\nhumanitarian law."," Accordingly, this report does not address who was responsible\nfor the armed conflict between Hezbollah and Israel or which party was justified\nin waging war-the justness of the cause does not affect the international humanitarian\nlaw analysis."," Assessment of Hezbollah's Rocket Attacks \n This report details dozens of Hezbollah rocket attacks that\nhit civilian areas in Israel.","\nIt does not include every rocket, or every city that was hit, or every case\ninvolving fatalities."," Nevertheless, the cases that we did examine show a\npattern, consistent with Hezbollah's statements throughout the war, of firing\nindiscriminately and in some cases deliberately at civilians and civilian\nstructures, in violation of international humanitarian law."," Our information\ncomes from visits both during the conflict and after to towns and villages hit\nby rockets; inspection of ordnance and shrapnel collected in these places;\ninterviews with civilian eyewitnesses, Israeli doctors who treated the injured,\nIsraeli civilian authorities, officials of the Israel Police and of the Israel\nDefense Forces (IDF) Home Front Command; published sources of information on weapons; statements by Hezbollah\nofficials; and information collected\nfrom international and nongovernmental organizations in Lebanon."," To date, we have\nreceived no reply to questions submitted on April 30 to Hezbollah's leadership\nabout its rocket attacks (see Appendix)."," Hezbollah repeatedly fired\nrockets in the direction of civilian populated areas in which there was no\nevident military target-violating the prohibition against attacking civilians."," In\nother cases, we identified potential fixed or mobile military targets in the\nvicinity of Hezbollah attacks that killed or wounded Israeli civilians."," Whether\nHezbollah was aiming its rockets at military targets in these cases was\ndifficult to determine."," But because the weapons it used are insufficiently\naccurate in populated settings, these operations would nonetheless violate the\nhumanitarian law prohibition against indiscriminate attacks."," Hezbollah claims\nit targeted and hit military objects more than is known, blaming Israeli\ncensorship for a cover-up."," But even if it were to emerge that Hezbollah\ntargeted military objectives in northern Israel to a greater degree than is\nrecognized, there would still be a clear pattern of rocket fire that targeted\ncivilians, directly or indiscriminately, in violation of international law."," In their choice of rockets, the Hezbollah commanders\nresponsible demonstrated, at minimum, a reckless disregard for the likelihood\nthat their weapons would harm civilians."," To our knowledge, all of the rockets\nfired by Hezbollah lacked guidance systems."," Thus, Hezbollah forces could direct\na rocket at a general target, but without precision."," Many of those that hit the\nmost densely populated coastal areas-the city of Haifa and the string of its\nsuburbs to the north and east known as HaKrayot-were 220mm rockets packed with\nthousands of 6mm steel spheres (sometimes referred to as ball bearings) that\nsprayed out upon impact with great force."," These spheres are devastating\nanti-personnel weapons: while incapable of inflicting serious damage to hard\nmilitary structures or matriel, they penetrate human flesh and organs within a\nwide radius of the rocket blast."," Hezbollah also fired an undetermined number of\ncluster munition rockets loaded with submunitions (i.",", explosives) that, upon\nimpact, dispersed 3mm steel spheres over a wide footprint."," The prohibition on indiscriminate attacks applies not only\nto civilians but also to civilian objects-buildings and other structures."," So\nlong as these objects have not become military objectives-such as being used as\ndefensive positions or headquarters-warring parties may not attack them,\npurposefully or indiscriminately."," Civilian structures are deserving of protection\nin their own right and because they tend to house civilians."," Hezbollah's efforts to hit industrial and infrastructural\ntargets in the port\n of Haifa and its\nnortheastern suburbs were lawful under international humanitarian law only if\nthe targeted facilities made an \"effective contribution to military action\" and\ntheir destruction would have provided Hezbollah \"a definite military\nadvantage.","\" [10] \nTypically lawful targets would include facilities providing direct support to\nactive military operations."," Assessment of Hezbollah's Wartime Statements \n Hezbollah stated that it fired some 8,000 rockets into Israel during\nthe 34-day conflict (see below)."," Israeli officials stated that the number was\n3,917, [12] \nof which 23 percent landed within \"built-up areas."," Hezbollah claimed that its rockets had hit military targets\ninside Israel\nmore often than the media was reporting."," But the 89 wartime Hezbollah\ncommuniqus that we examined concerning rocket attacks on Israel claim twenty-two attacks on\nspecific military objects, such as IDF bases, and at least four times that\nnumber of attacks on specific civilian settlements."," [14] \nAnd in those rare instances when it hit civilians and then expressed regret for\nhaving done so, for example, when a rocket killed two Palestinian-Israeli boys\nin Nazareth on July 19, and when another rocket\nkilled two elderly Palestinian-Israelis in Haifa on August 6-Hezbollah did not specify\nthe intended target of these rockets."," These statements, coupled with the evidence collected on the\nground in northern Israel,\nleave no doubt that Hezbollah deliberately or indiscriminately fired rockets at\ncivilians much of the time."," Commanders ordering such rocket fire and acting\nwith criminal intent or reckless disregard for civilians were committing war\ncrimes."," Hezbollah leaders and spokesmen stated clearly and often\nthat they had directly targeted towns and villages, usually justifying their\nactions as reprisals for Israeli strikes on Lebanese civilians and often\nphrasing their explanations in self-serving terms."," Four days into the conflict,\nfor example, on July 16, after a steel sphere-loaded 220mm Hezbollah rocket\nkilled eight railway workers in Haifa, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan\nNasrallah went on television, explaining: ."," On the first day we aimed our rocket firing toward military\nsites only, and did not attack any Israeli colony or settlement in the north of\noccupied Palestine.","\nBut the army of the enemy, helpless before the Moujahideen, started from the\nfirst day targeting towns, villages and civilians and civilian installations\nand infrastructure ."," \n Today we had no choice but to renege on the pledge we had\nmade to ourselves and proceeded to bomb the city of Haifa, knowing the importance and dangerous\nnature of this city ."," \n [A]s long as the enemy undertakes its aggression without\nlimits or red lines, we will respond without limits or red lines ."," The fact that Hezbollah's wartime communiqus claimed\nsuccess in hitting not only military targets but, far more often, civilian\ncommunities shows that Hezbollah understood the difference between the two and\nstrongly suggests it was purposefully aiming at civilians some of the time."," In response to Zionist attacks against Lebanese civilian\nareas, the Islamic resistance, at 11:30 a.",", bombed the two enemy settlements\nin Tzuriel and Safed with tens of rockets."," It also targeted with rockets the\nheadquarters of the Northern Region Command in Biranit barracks and `Ayn Hamour\nmilitary base, east Tiberias, bombed for the first time ."," \n In response to the continuing Zionist enemy aggression\nagainst Lebanese civilians, the Islamic Resistance bombed, at 11:40 a.",", the\nsettlements of Goren, Eilon, Ma'alot, Kfar Vradim and Elkosh with tens of\nrockets."," \n The Islamic Resistance directed at 12:00 midday batches of\nrockets in the direction of Kabri and Tiberias settlements."," On August 9, three days after Hezbollah rockets killed Arab\nresidents of Haifa\nfor the first time, and three weeks after they began killing and injuring\nJewish residents, Nasrallah publicly urged Arab residents of the city to flee\nfor their own safety: ."," We have\ngrieved and we are grieving for your martyrs and wounded people."," Over the past\nperiod, your presence and your misfortune made us hesitant in targeting this\ncity, despite the fact that the southern suburbs [of Beirut] and the rest of\nthe heart of Lebanon were being shelled, whether Haifa was being shelled or\nnot."," Please relieve us of this hesitation and spare your blood, which is also\nour blood."," Nasrallah's statement indicates that Hezbollah's rocket\nattacks were either directed at Haifa's\nJewish residents or that Hezbollah knew they were endangering the city's\ncivilians but did not care so long as the victims were Jews, indicating at a\nminimum an intent to recklessly subject them to indiscriminate attack."," International humanitarian law also prohibits attacks the\nprimary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population."," In\neach case, a violation exists, whether or not the attack actually results in\nsignificant civilian casualties.","According to a pronouncement made by its\nsecretary-general on July 29, Hezbollah sought to cripple everyday life in\nnorthern Israel\nby compelling the flight of the civilian population in the north either to\nshelters or to the southern half of the country: ."," When, throughout the Arab-Israeli conflict [have] 2 million\nIsraelis [been] forced [before] to leave their areas or stay in shelters for 18\ndays or more? This number will increase when we expand the \"beyond-Haifa\"\nstage."," The shelling of the city of Afula and its military base represented the\nbeginning of this stage."," Many cities in the centre will be a target in the\nbeyond-Haifa stage if the barbaric aggression against our homeland, people, and\nvillages continues."," Indeed, Hezbollah's actions resulted in twenty-five to fifty\npercent of the population fleeing their homes in some cities where there was no\nsignificant military target in their midst, such as Kiryat Shmona, Karmiel, and\nNahariya."," Thousands of those who remained spent days or nights confined to\nshelters or safe rooms in their homes."," Since the conflict ended in August 2006, Hezbollah and its\nleaders have not to our knowledge acknowledged in any way that its methods of\nfiring rockets into Israel were much of the time in violation of humanitarian\nlaw."," Nor has the government of Lebanon\nannounced that it would conduct an investigation or review of Hezbollah's\nconduct."," International Humanitarian Law and Asymmetrical\nConflicts \n The fighting between Hezbollah and Israel has\nraised issues concerning the implementation of international humanitarian law\nin so-called asymmetrical conflicts-those between a low-technology adversary\nand a high-technology adversary."," The question is whether the obligation to take\nprecautions to minimize civilian harm is the same for all belligerents, or\ndepends on the technological level of the belligerents."," Does humanitarian law\nunfairly penalize a low-tech belligerent like Hezbollah equipped with unguided\nrockets by holding it to the same international standards of civilian\nprotection-no indiscriminate attacks-as a high-tech belligerent with\nprecision-guided weaponry? ."," International humanitarian law places prohibitions on those\nmeans and methods of warfare that cannot differentiate between combatants and\ncivilians and thus cause needless harm to civilians."," Sophisticated \"smart\"\nbombs and precision-guided missiles may be able to be used where unguided\nrockets and other less sophisticated \"dumb\" weapons would invariably be\nindiscriminate."," This clearly puts pressure on low-tech armed forces and\nnon-state armed groups to find alternative ways of waging war, such as by\nconducting raids against military targets in enemy territory or using sniper\nfire, rocket-propelled grenades, or other weapons capable of aiming with\nreasonable precision at military targets."," Even if those methods of attack place\nthe low-tech force at a disadvantage, the function of humanitarian law is not\nto ensure an even-handed contest between belligerents, but to spare the\ncivilian population as much as possible from the horrors of war."," To permit\notherwise unlawful uses of weapons for cost reasons would create a crude\ncalculus where civilian suffering would be pegged to the financial means of the\nbelligerents."," It would also have the effect, again at the expense of civilians,\nof deterring armies from purchasing or developing weapons that were more\nsophisticated and better able to spare civilian lives."," At the same time, the prohibition against indiscriminate\nattacks also places significant legal burdens on high-tech armed forces."," Where\narmies have a choice of weapons for an attack, they must when feasible use the\none that minimizes the loss of civilian life."," That puts pressure on them to use\nonly precision-guided weapons when attacking populated areas."," Nor can they\njustify unlawful attacks because a low-tech adversary, less well armed and\ntrained, is committing abuses."," As one humanitarian law scholar writes:\n\"Suggesting that a party with the technological ability to exercise great care\nin attack need not do so because its opponent is not similarly equipped runs\ncounter\" to protecting those not participating in hostilities."," Israel 's Obligations to Take Precautions against\nthe Effects of Attacks ."," Parties to an armed conflict are obligated under\ninternational humanitarian law to take all feasible precautions to protect the\ncivilian population under their control against the effects of attack."," [20] \nThis includes not locating military targets within or near densely populated\nareas [21] \nand removing civilians from the vicinity of military objectives."," Throughout the north of the country, fixed military\nfacilities, such as IDF bases, are located next to or in the midst of civilian\nsettlements."," The IDF northern command headquarters is located in the city of Safed."," The Israeli navy\nhas a major training base on the Haifa\nwaterfront, next to a major hospital and a neighborhood of low-rise apartment\nbuildings."," In some instances, the IDF fired artillery into Lebanon\nfrom locations quite near to residential communities, such as the border\nvillages of Zarit and Arab al-Aramshe (for the latter, see case study below).","\nThese artillery emplacements constitute military objects; in some of its\nwartime communiqus, Hezbollah announced that it had directed its rockets at\nsuch artillery positions inside Israel."," Israel\nundertook extensive efforts to shelter or evacuate civilians in northern Israel,\nefforts that almost certainly reduced the number of civilian casualties\ninflicted by rockets fired by Hezbollah during this conflict."," Nevertheless,\nquestions remain whether Israel\ncomplied fully with the norm requiring it to avoid, to the extent feasible,\nlocating military objectives within or near densely populated areas and to\nadequately protect all citizens residing near military assets."," But even where Israel may have failed in this regard, international\nhumanitarian law still requires warring parties to discriminate at all times\nbetween noncombatants and legitimate military targets, firing at only the\nlatter, and only when the expected civilian loss is not disproportionate to the\nanticipated military gain."," Hezbollah's failure to comply with these\nrequirements was the principal cause of the wartime civilian casualties in Israel.","\n(See below, chapter on Israel's\nObligations to Take Precautions against the Effects of Attacks."," A note on Israeli Censorship \n Citing national security concerns, Israeli military\nauthorities limited the amount of information publicly available about various\naspects of the war, including certain information on where Hezbollah rockets\nlanded during the conflict."," These restrictions limited our ability to fully\ninvestigate the pattern of Hezbollah attacks."," On July 16, four days after the conflict broke out, IDF\nmilitary censor Col."," Sima Vaknin-Gil issued guidelines to journalists banning\nreporting on, among other things, \"visits of Israeli government and IDF\nofficials in the north of Israel until the visits are over due to the clear\nconnection between officials' visits and missile attacks on the area in\nquestion,\" \"missile hits at IDF bases and/or strategic facilities,\" \"missiles\nthat fall in the Mediterranean Sea,\" and \"real-time reporting on the exact\nlocation of rocket hits."," Israeli authorities readily acknowledged to Human Rights\nWatch that some rockets landed in military zones or hit military targets that\nwere off-limits to the public, but declined requests by Human Rights Watch to\nprovide details of such incidents."," We also encountered restrictions on\ninformation concerning certain industrial targets."," For example, Kobi Bachar,\nchief of police for the Zvulon district north of Haifa, said, \"Hezbollah was trying to hit the\npetrochemical plants in our area."," We had hits within the factories, but because\nof censorship, I do not know if I am allowed to give you that information."," On July 19, Human Rights Watch researchers visiting Haifa's RambamHospital met an IDF\nsoldier being treated for an injury sustained when a rocket hit an air force\nbase just outside the city."," He said that the IDF had instructed him not to\nspeak to the press, and in fact the news media never, to our knowledge,\nreported that rocket attack."," A physician at Rambam who said he treated the\nsoldier also told us that the IDF had prevented that particular rocket strike\nfrom being publicized."," Human Rights Watch has addressed an extensive list of\nrecommendations to the Israeli authorities regarding its compliance with\ninternational humanitarian law during the 2006 armed conflict in Lebanon and in Gaza (see Fatal Strikes: Israel's\nIndiscriminate Attacks against Civilians in Lebanon and the forthcoming Why\nThey Died: Civilian Deaths in Lebanon during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War ).","\nBelow we make a series of recommendations that are limited to the subject of\nthis report, Hezbollah's firing of rockets into Israel during the 2006 conflict and\nhumanitarian law violations."," We urge the government of Lebanon , while recognizing the\npolitical difficulties it faces, to take the following measures at the earliest\ntime feasible, consistent with its state responsibilities and obligations: ."," We urge the governments of Syria and Iran, as longtime supporters and\nreported arms suppliers to Hezbollah, to: ."," We urge the governments of the United States , the European Union and other nations\nhaving relations with the government of Iran\nand Syria\nto: ."," Noting that both the Lebanese government and the Israeli\ngovernment have failed so far to investigate violations of international\nhumanitarian law on their territory, we call on the Secretary General of the\nUnited Nations to: ."," Applicable International Law \n The armed conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in July-August\n2006 fell within a body of law called international humanitarian law, also\nknown as the laws of war."," The sources of humanitarian law are treaty law and\ncustomary law, which bind both states and non-state armed groups."," The most relevant treaty law to the 2006 conflict is the\nGeneva Conventions of 1949, to which virtually all states are party."," Article 2\ncommon to the 1949 Geneva Conventions provides for the full applicability of\nthe conventions when there is an armed conflict between High Contracting\nParties (that is, states), or when there has been a partial or total occupation\nof a High Contracting Party (even when that occupation meets with no resistance\nfrom the state)."," [25] \nAt least to the extent of armed hostilities between the states of Israel and Lebanon and Israeli control over\nLebanese territory, the 2006 conflict was an international armed conflict."," In\ngeneral, the 1949 Geneva Conventions provide for the security and well-being of\npersons no longer taking part in the hostilities, namely captured combatants, the\nwounded, and civilians in the control of belligerent forces."," They also provide\nspecial protections, for instance, to medical personnel and hospitals."," There has been controversy over\nthe humanitarian law applicable to Hezbollah."," Unless Hezbollah forces are\nconsidered to be either a part of the Lebanese armed forces, or demonstrated\nallegiance to such forces, or were under the direction or effective control of\nthe government of Lebanon, [26] \nthere is a basis for finding that hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah\nare covered by the humanitarian law rules for a non-international armed\nconflict."," [27] \nUnder such a characterization, applicable treaty law would be common article 3\nto the 1949 Geneva Conventions (the \"treaty within a treaty\"), which protects\ncaptured combatants and civilians from murder, cruel and inhuman treatment,\nbeing held as hostages, and unfair trials."," Whether captured Hezbollah fighters\nwould be entitled to the protections of the Third Geneva Convention for\nprisoners of war, the Fourth Geneva Convention for protected persons, or only\nthe basic protections of common article 3, would depend on the legal\ncharacterization of the conflict and a factual analysis of Hezbollah and its\nrelationship to the Lebanese armed forces."," Such an analysis is not necessary\nfor evaluating the conduct of the hostilities between Israel and\nHezbollah, the focus of this report, because the governing substantive\nprovisions would be effectively the same."," International humanitarian law on the conduct of\nhostilities, traditionally known as \"Hague law\" because historically treaties\nregulating combat were drafted there, is set out in the Hague Regulations of 1907 [29] \nand the First Additional Protocol of 1977 to the Geneva Conventions (Protocol\nI)."," [30] \nProtocol I, which provides the most detailed and current provisions on the\nconduct of hostilities during international armed conflicts, was not directly\napplicable to the 2006 conflict because Israel is not a party to the\ntreaty."," Nevertheless, many of the provisions of Protocol I have been recognized\nby states, including Israel,\nto be reflective of customary international law."," [31] \nThus the legal analysis applied in this report frequently references norms\nenshrined in Protocol I, but as an important source of customary law rather\nthan as a treaty obligation."," Customary humanitarian law as it relates to the\nfundamental principles concerning conduct of hostilities is now recognized as\nlargely the same whether it is applied to an international or a\nnon-international armed conflict."," Protections for Civilians and Civilian Objects \n International\nhumanitarian law limits permissible means and methods of warfare by parties to\nan armed conflict and requires them to respect and protect civilians and\ncaptured combatants."," \"Means\" of combat refers generally to the weapons used,\nwhile \"methods\" refers to the manner in which such weapons are used."," The First Additional Protocol of\n1977 to the Geneva Conventions (Protocol I) and the 1907 Hague Regulations lay\nout the law that protects civilians during armed conflict."," Most of the relevant\nprovisions of both treaties are considered customary law, rules of\ninternational law that are based on established state practice and are binding\non all parties to an armed conflict, whether they are state actors or non-state\narmed groups."," The two fundamental tenets of international humanitarian law\nare those of \"civilian immunity\" and \"distinction.","\" [34] \nThey impose a duty, at all times during the conflict, to distinguish between\ncombatants and civilians, and to target only the former."," Article 48 of Protocol\nI states, \"the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between\nthe civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and\nmilitary objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against\nmilitary objectives.","\" [35] \nWhile Protocol I recognizes that some civilian casualties are inevitable,\nparties to a conflict may not target civilians and civilian objects and may\ndirect their operations against only military objectives."," Civilian objects are those that are not considered military\nobjectives."," [36] \nMilitary objectives are combatants and those objects that \"by their nature,\nlocation, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and\nwhose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the\ncircumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.","\" [37] \nIn general the law prohibits direct attacks against what are by their nature\ncivilian objects, such as homes and apartments, places of worship, hospitals,\nschools, or cultural monuments, unless they are being used for military\npurposes."," Civilian hospitals enjoy a status of special protection\nunder the Fourth Geneva Convention beyond their immunity as civilian objects.","\nShould they be used for committing acts harmful to the enemy outside their\nhumanitarian duties, protection may cease \"only after due warning has been\ngiven, naming, in all appropriate cases, a reasonable time limit, and after\nsuch warning has remained unheeded.","\" [39] \nAdditionally, the \"fact that sick or wounded members of the armed forces are\nnursed in these hospitals, or the presence of small arms and ammunition taken\nfrom such combatants and not yet handed to the proper service, shall not be\nconsidered to be acts harmful to the enemy."," Parties to a conflict must not make threats or commit acts\nof violence \"the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the\ncivilian population.","\" [41] \nReprisals that involve attacks against the civilian population are also\nprohibited."," [42] \nReprisals have been defined as an otherwise unlawful action \"that in\nexceptional cases is considered lawful under international law when used as an\nenforcement measure in reaction to unlawful acts of an adversary.","\" [43] \nInternational law has outlawed any direct attack on civilians, whether in\nreprisal or not, in part because attacks ostensibly launched as reprisals often\nspur counterattacks by the other side and there is no end to the cycle of\ncivilian injury and death."," International humanitarian law prohibits indiscriminate\nattacks."," As a matter of both treaty and customary law, indiscriminate attacks\nare \"of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian\nobjects without distinction.","\" Article 51(4) and Article 51(5) of Protocol I\nenumerate five kinds of indiscriminate attacks: those that 1) are not directed\nat a \"specific military objective,\" 2) cannot be directed at \"a\nspecific military objective,\" 3) have effects that violate the Protocol,\n4) treat separate urban military objectives as one (carpet bombing), or 5) violate\nthe principle of proportionality."," For example, if a combatant launches an attack without\nattempting to aim properly at a military target, or in such a way as to hit\ncivilians without regard to the likely extent of death or injury, it would\namount to an indiscriminate attack."," Similarly, any attack, whether by aerial\nbombardment or other means, that treats as a single military objective a number\nof clearly separated and distinct military objectives located in a city, town,\nvillage or other area containing a concentration of civilians and civilian\nobjects, is regarded as an indiscriminate attack and prohibited."," Also prohibited are attacks that\nviolate the principle of proportionality."," Disproportionate attacks are those\nthat are \"expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to\ncivilians [or] damage to civilian objectives ."," which would be excessive in\nrelation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated\" from that\nattack."," [45] \nThe expected danger to the civilian population and civilian objects depends on\nvarious factors, including their location (possibly within or near a military\nobjective), the accuracy of the weapons used (depending on the trajectory, the\nrange, environmental factors, the ammunition used, etc.","), and the technical\nskill of the combatants (which can lead to random launching of weapons when\ncombatants are unable to hit the intended target)."," International humanitarian law requires that the parties to\na conflict take constant care during military operations to spare the civilian\npopulation and to take all feasible precautions to avoid or minimize the\nincidental loss of civilian life, as well as injury to civilians and damage to\ncivilian objects."," [47] Feasible precautions have been defined\nas \"those precautions which are practicable or practically possible taking into\naccount all circumstances ruling at the time, including humanitarian and\nmilitary considerations.","\" [48] \nIn its authoritative Commentary on Protocol I, the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross explains that the requirement to take all \"feasible\"\nprecautions means, among other things, that the person launching an attack is\nrequired to take the steps needed to identify the target as a legitimate\nmilitary objective \"in good time to spare the population as far as possible."," Parties to a conflict are also prohibited from using\ncivilians \"to shield military objectives from attacks\" or using their presence\n\"to shield, favor or impede military operations.","\" [56] \nIf one party uses civilians as shields, however, the other must still follow\ninternational humanitarian law, avoiding indiscriminate attacks and taking\nprecautions to protect civilians."," \"Dual-use targets\" sometimes blur the distinction between\ncivilian and military objects."," Dual-use facilities, such as electrical and\nindustrial facilities, are those that can have both a military and civilian\napplication."," A dual-use object may be a legitimate military target because it\nmakes an \"effective contribution to military action\" and its destruction offers\n\"a definite military advantage."," Furthermore, the harm to the civilian\npopulation in its destruction may be disproportionate to the expected \"concrete\nand direct military advantage,\" rendering an attack impermissible."," [58] \nIn assessing potential targets, military planners carefully must balance the\nconcrete and direct military advantage of destroying these facilities against\nthe expected harm to civilians and damage to civilian objects."," With respect to individual\nresponsibility, serious violations of international humanitarian law, when\ncommitted with criminal intent, are war crimes."," This would include deliberate attacks\non civilians, as well as indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks when done\nwith knowledge or reckless indifference to their illegal character."," Individuals\nmay also be held criminally liable for attempting to commit a war crime, as\nwell as planning, instigating, assisting in, facilitating, aiding or abetting a\nwar crime."," [60] \nCommanders and civilian leaders may be prosecuted for war crimes as a matter of\ncommand responsibility when they knew or should have known about the commission\nof war crimes and took insufficient measures to prevent them or punish those\nresponsible."," Table: Main types of rockets fired by Hezbollah into Israel\nduring 2006 conflict, according to data provided by Israeli

by spewing projectiles in every direction.","\nAlthough not all projectiles are literally \"fragments,\" the most common\nprojectiles employed by Hezbollah rockets are: razor-sharp jagged pieces

effects cause serious damage to humans."," During the 2006 conflict, Hezbollah fired into Israel\nat least six types of ground-launched rockets, according to Israeli officials."," [65] \nThe main

122mm rockets fired by\nHezbollah are frequently and informally referred to as \"Katyushas.","\" The term\noriginally was used by Soviet soldiers during World War II to refer to 82mm and\n132mm rockets used by USSR\nforces."," Since then it has become a colloquial term for any unguided rockets\ntypically fired from multiple-barrel launchers off of flat-bed trucks."," In addition to the standard 122mm rockets, Hezbollah fired\nenhanced-range 122mm Chinese-made rockets, 220mm Uragan rockets, and a smaller\nnumber of 240mm and 302mm rockets."," Hezbollah also fired a small number

Kourani\u2019s IJO recruitment."," By then, IJO preoperational surveillance missions took on much more practical implications because of Hezbollah\u2019s desire to avenge Mughniyeh\u2019s death."," The group\u2019s goals changed considerably between 2002 and 2008."," Kourani informed the FBI that \u201cthere would be certain scenarios that would require action or conduct by those who belonged to

Israel for the first time on July 16, 2006 \u2013 four days into the Second Lebanon War."," Until then it had relied on regular and enhanced-range 122 mm rockets."," Photo: Omri Eilat \n The Khaibar-1 rocket is an unguided artillery rocket, developed and manufactured by Syria."," Reports suggest the Khaibar-1 is based heavily on the Chinese Wei Shi (WS-1) MRL system."," The rocket is named after the 629 CE Battle of Khaibar, fought between early Muslims and resident Jews."," The Khaibar-1 has a range of 100 km while carrying a 150 kg payload."," It is typically equipped with large, anti-personnel warheads."," 33 The launcher features two layers of three firing tubes each."," 34 The Khaibar-1 is unguided but more accurate than most indigenous Hezbollah/Hamas rockets, and can be stored more easily due to increased durability."," However, the rocket does not spin like the Fajr-5, and is therefore likely less accurate."," The Khaibar-1 was first fired by Hezbollah on July 28, 2006, striking the city of Afula."," Subsequent targets included Haifa, Hadera, and areas in the northern West Bank."," Photo: Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty Images \n The Zelzal is an Iranian variant of the Soviet FROG 7 artillery ballistic missile."," It has a substantially higher range and payload than Hezbollah\u2019s Katyusha and Fajr rockets, providing the group with the capability to target deep within Israel."," The Zelzal-1 has a range of 125-160 km while carrying a 600 kg high explosive (HE) warhead.","325 m, a body diameter of 610 mm, and a launch weight of 2,950 kg."," The Zelzal-2 has a range of 210 km while carrying a 600 kg HE warhead."," The solid-fuel rocket shares the same length and diameter as its predecessor, but has an increased launch weight of 3,400 kg."," Iran reportedly began delivering the Zelzal-1 and -2 rockets through Syria to Hezbollah in the early 2000s."," Iran used transport planes to carry sophisticated missiles \u2013 including the Zelzal \u2013 into Syria, which were then smuggled to Hezbollah."," 39 Zelzal rockets are fairly inaccurate, and require a large transporter-erector launcher (TEL) vehicle with a large target signature."," 40 Israeli officials say the rocket\u2019s considerable payload makes it a serious threat."," 41 One 2006 report found that Hezbollah likely held \u201ca few dozen\u201d Zelzal rockets, while another cited as many as 200."," Hezbollah\u2019s Zelzals went unused during the 2006 war, likely due to Iranian influence (seeking to prevent further escalation), Israeli airpower (which could easily strike larger targets like Zelzals), or some combination of the two."," Photo: CSIS \n The Fateh-110 is an Iranian short-range, road-mobile ballistic missile."," It is most likely a modified version of the unguided Zelzal-2, with the addition of control and guidance systems."," The M-600, or \u201cTishreen,\u201d is a Syrian variant/copy of the Fateh-110 missile."," The Fateh-110 and M-600 have ranges of 250-300 km, making them among the longest-ranged weapons in Hezbollah\u2019s inventory."," Both missiles carry a 450-500 kg high explosive (HE) warhead and are GPS-guided, providing them with a CEP of 500 m."," They are nearly 9 m in length and weigh approximately 3,450 kg at launch."," In 2010, Israeli reports claimed that Syria had transferred a number of M-600 missiles to Hezbollah."," 45 Iran reportedly supplied Fateh-110s to Hezbollah around November 2014."," 46 Hezbollah is believed to hold hundreds of these missiles, with initial Fateh-110 transfers dating back to 2007 and M-600 transfers to 2010."," Unconfirmed reports indicate that Syria transferred an unknown number of Scud missiles (B, C, and/or D variants) to Hezbollah."," These reports emerged in late 2009, and again in April 2010 when then-Israeli President Shimon Peres directly accused Syria of transferring Scuds to Hezbollah."," Neither Israel nor the United States, however, have provided any evidence that Hezbollah is or ever has been in possession of Scuds."," 48 Reports also conflict on whether Hezbollah is capable of firing Scuds without foreign assistance."," Additionally, Scuds are usually seen as impractical weapons for Hezbollah in its war doctrine."," As one analyst explains, \u201cScuds are very bulky to transport and difficult to hide and manipulate, requiring 45 minutes of preparation."," They do not provide Hezbollah much advantage compared to the Fateh-110\u2026\u201d 49 ."," Scuds variants have ranges between 300-550 km while carrying a 600-985 kg payload."," 50 If Hezbollah does indeed have Scuds, it could use them to reach Israeli targets from Party-controlled territory in northern Lebanon."," Photo: Fars News Agency \n The C-802 is a medium-range antiship cruise missile (ASCM) developed by China in the 1970s-1980s."," Iran began buying dozens from the Chinese during the 1990s until the United States pressured Beijing to cease sales."," 51 Iran then developed its own variant, the \u201cNoor\u201d, and transferred it to Hezbollah."," 52 Hezbollah\u2019s C-802s are likely maintained and operated by Iranian military personnel."," The C-802 has a range of 120 km while carrying a 165 kg warhead.","39 m, a body diameter of 360 mm, and a launch weight of 715-800 kg."," The missile is turbo-jet powered, high-speed subsonic, and sea-skimming capable."," On July 14, 2006, Hezbollah fired two C-802s at the Israeli Saar-class corvette Hanit, which was enforcing a blockade along the Lebanese coast."," One of the missiles successfully hit the vessel, killing four Israeli sailors."," 54 Until the strike, no one \u2013 including Western intelligence services \u2013 knew that Iran had managed to ship C-802 missiles to Hezbollah."," It is unclear how many C-802 ASCMs Hezbollah currently holds."," Photo: Wikipedia \n The Yakhont is an antiship cruise missile (ASCM) developed by Russia in the 1990s."," The Yakhont has a range of 300 km while carrying either a 200 kg high explosive (HE) or 250 kg semi-armor piercing (SAP) warhead.","6 m in length, with a body diameter of 670 mm and a launch weight of 3,000 kg."," It is supersonic, capable of sea-skimming flight, and employs inertial navigation-based guidance."," Russia delivered 72 Yakhont coastal defense missiles to Syria in December 2011, along with 18 TEL vehicles."," Additional shipments of more advanced, radar-equipped variants followed in May 2013."," 57 Syria transferred a number of these systems to Hezbollah."," As of January 2016, the United States estimates that Hezbollah possesses up to 12 Yakhont ASCMs."," 58 However, reports suggest that Hezbollah does not have the means to launch the missile without Iranian and/or Syrian support."," 59 Israel considers the Yakhont one of the main threats it faces from Hezbollah, as the missile threatens shipping along Israel\u2019s entire coastline and could complicate any potential blockade of Lebanon."," Antitank Missiles (ATMs) \n According to Israeli tank commanders at the front of the 2006 War, Hezbollah\u2019s anti-tank missiles damaged or destroyed Israeli vehicles on about 20% of their hits."," 60 The party successfully struck nearly 50 Israeli Merkava tanks during the conflict, penetrating the armor of 21."," Hezbollah used ATGMs against buildings and Israeli troop bunkers as well."," As Anthony Cordesman writes, \u201cMore [Israeli] infantry soldiers were killed by anti-tank weapons than in hand-to-hand combat.","\u201d 61 While fighting ISIS in Syria and Iraq, Hezbollah has effectively used ATMs to counter suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive devises (SVBIED) launched by the extremist group."," Photo: Wikipedia \n The RPG-29 is an unguided rocket-propelled grenade launcher (RPG) developed by the Soviet Union in the 1980s."," It was designed to give mobile infantry units the ability to penetrate and destroy enemy tanks."," The RPG-29 has an effective range of 450-500 meters while carrying a 4.","2 mm rocket is equipped with a tandem-shaped warhead, which was designed to counter reactive armor like that used on many Israeli vehicles."," Some versions are also equipped with thermal-imaging capability for night warfare and tracking heat signatures."," Russia sold the RPG-29 to Syria between 1990-1999, which in turn provided the system to Hezbollah in the early 2000s."," 65 Hezbollah first used the RPG-29 in November 2005 when the party launched an unsuccessful kidnapping attempt on the IDF position at Ghajar."," 66 Israeli officials claim that the RPG-29 was a leading cause of IDF casualties during the 2006 Lebanon War, penetrating Merkava tank armor on multiple occasions."," Photo: Israel Defense Forces ( Flickr ) \n The AT-3 Sagger is a manual command to line of sight (MCLOS) wire-guided anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) developed by the Soviet Union in in the early 1960s."," The Iranian variant, known as \u2018Raad,\u2019 carries a double tandem-type warhead, which was designed to counter reactive armor like that used on many Israeli vehicles."," 68 Hezbollah is estimated to hold hundreds of Iran- and Syria-supplied AT-3s."," Following training provided by Iran and Syria, Hezbollah used the AT-3 against Israeli forces during the 2006 Lebanon War to high effect."," When Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon, it left behind about 40 armored vehicles \u2013 most destroyed by AT-3s."," Hezbollah also used the AT-3 \u201clike artillery\u201d to hit houses and other soft targets holding IDF soldiers."," ( Flickr ) \n The AT-4 Spigot is a semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) wire-guided anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) developed by the Soviet Union in the 1960s."," The second-generation ATGM has an effective range of up to 2."," 71

provided Hezbollah with domestic copies of the AT-5."," Photo: Wikipedia \n The AT-13 Saxhorn-2 is a wire-guided anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) developed by Russia in the early 1990s."," The rocket is equipped with a tandem-shaped warhead, which was designed to counter reactive armor like that used on many Israeli vehicles."," 74 Russia sold the AT-13 to Syria, which then provided the weapons to Hezbollah in the early 2000s."," Photo: Wikipedia \n The AT-14 Kornet is a laser-guided anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) developed by Russia in the 1990s."," It is likely Hezbollah\u2019s longest-range ATGM, with an effective range of about 5 km while carrying an anti-armor or bunker-busting thermobaric warhead."," The third-generation system also has thermal-imaging capability for night warfare and tracking heat signatures."," Russia sold the AT-14 to Syria between 1990-1999, which in turn provided hundreds to Hezbollah soon thereafter."," 77 Hezbollah had the AT-14 during the 2006 Lebanon War, but only used it in limited numbers, likely waiting for Israeli forces to move farther into southern Lebanon and extend their supply lines."," The AT-14 was demonstrably effective against Israeli Merkava tanks."," 78 Israeli analysts worry that Russia-Hezbollah cooperation in Syria may result in the Party receiving more AT-14s."," Antiair Missiles (AAMs) \n Most of Hezbollah\u2019s antiair missile systems offer only a relatively small area of protection."," They nevertheless force Israeli aircraft to fly at higher altitudes, reducing Israel\u2019s ability to accurately strike ground-based targets."," 80 Israeli policymakers and military officers have consistently reiterated their concerns about Hezbollah acquiring more sophisticated air defenses from Bashar al-Assad\u2019s Syria."," Photo: ISNA News Agency \n The Misagh-1 is a second-generation, man-portable anti-air missile (MANPAD) developed by Iran in 1994."," Iran subsequently developed the fourth-generation
